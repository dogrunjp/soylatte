Identification of intron/exon boundaries is an essential part of genome annotation, yet remains a challenge. Here, we present supersplat, a method for unbiased splice-junction discovery through empirical RNA-seq data.Using a genomic reference and RNA-seq high-throughput sequencing datasets, supersplat empirically identifies potential splice junctions at a rate of approximately 11.4 million reads per hour. We further benchmark the performance of the algorithm by mapping Illumina RNA-seq reads to identify introns in the genome of the reference dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana and we demonstrate the utility of supersplat for de novo empirical annotation of splice junctions using the reference monocot plant Brachypodium distachyon.Implemented in C++, supersplat source code and binaries are freely available on the web at http://mocklerlab-tools.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/.","Bryant DW Jr, Shen R, Priest HD, Wong WK, Mockler TC."],["20122235","Genome-wide sequence-based prediction of peripheral proteins using a novel semi-supervised learning technique.","BMC Bioinformatics","2010","SRA009031","In supervised learning, traditional approaches to building a classifier use two sets of examples with pre-defined classes along with a learning algorithm. The main limitation of this approach is that examples from both classes are required which might be infeasible in certain cases, especially those dealing with biological data. Such is the case for membrane-binding peripheral domains that play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking by reversibly binding to membranes. For these domains, a well-defined positive set is available with domains known to bind membrane along with a large unlabeled set of domains whose membrane binding affinities have not been measured. The aforementioned limitation can be addressed by a special class of semi-supervised machine learning called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning that uses a positive set with a large unlabeled set. METHODS In this study, we implement the first application of PU-learning to a protein function prediction problem: identification of peripheral domains. PU-learning starts by identifying reliable negative (RN) examples iteratively from the unlabeled set until convergence and builds a classifier using the positive and the final RN set. A data set of 232 positive cases and ~3750 unlabeled ones were used to construct and validate the protocol.Holdout evaluation of the protocol on a left-out positive set showed that the accuracy of prediction reached up to 95% during two independent implementations.These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains. Protocols like the one presented here become particularly useful in the case of availability of information from one class only.","Bhardwaj N, Gerstein M, Lu H."]],["SRP000935","placeholder","Alternative splicing was profiled in Arabidopsis thaliana using Illumina-based RNA-seq.

Several MIRNA families are conserved deeply through land plants, but many are present only in closely related species or are species specific. The finding of numerous evolutionarily young MIRNA, many with low expression and few if any targets, supports a rapid birth-death model for MIRNA evolution. A systematic analysis of MIRNA genes and families in the close relatives, Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, was conducted using both whole-genome comparisons and high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs. Orthologs of 143 A. thaliana MIRNA genes were identified in A. lyrata, with nine having significant sequence or processing changes that likely alter function. In addition, at least 13% of MIRNA genes in each species are unique, despite their relatively recent speciation (approximately 10 million years ago). Alignment of MIRNA foldbacks to the Arabidopsis genomes revealed evidence for recent origins of 32 families by inverted or direct duplication of mostly protein-coding gene sequences, but less than half of these yield miRNA that are predicted to target transcripts from the originating gene family. miRNA nucleotide divergence between A. lyrata and A. thaliana orthologs was higher for young MIRNA genes, consistent with reduced purifying selection compared with deeply conserved MIRNA genes. Additionally, target sites of younger miRNA were lost more frequently than for deeply conserved families. In summary, our systematic analyses emphasize the dynamic nature of the MIRNA complement of plant genomes.","Fahlgren N, Jogdeo S, Kasschau KD, Sullivan CM, Chapman EJ, Laubinger S, Smith LM, Dasenko M, Givan SA, Weigel D, Carrington JC."]],["SRP002524","no study abstract","Summary: \n\nDeep sequencing of small RNA from three closely related brassicaceae A. thaliana, A. lyrata and Capsella rubella was done to systematically analyze the evolution of MIRNA genes and their targets.\nOverall Design: Small RNA were extracted from total RNA by size fractionation and converted to DNA amplicons by serial adaptor ligation to both ends followed by RT-PCR.

The main limitation of this approach is that examples from both classes are required which might be infeasible in certain cases, especially those dealing with biological data. Such is the case for membrane-binding peripheral domains that play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking by reversibly binding to membranes. For these domains, a well-defined positive set is available with domains known to bind membrane along with a large unlabeled set of domains whose membrane binding affinities have not been measured. The aforementioned limitation can be addressed by a special class of semi-supervised machine learning called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning that uses a positive set with a large unlabeled set. METHODS In this study, we implement the first application of PU-learning to a protein function prediction problem: identification of peripheral domains. PU-learning starts by identifying reliable negative (RN) examples iteratively from the unlabeled set until convergence and builds a classifier using the positive and the final RN set. A data set of 232 positive cases and ~3750 unlabeled ones were used to construct and validate the protocol.Holdout evaluation of the protocol on a left-out positive set showed that the accuracy of prediction reached up to 95% during two independent implementations.These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains. Protocols like the one presented here become particularly useful in the case of availability of information from one class only.","Bhardwaj N, Gerstein M, Lu H."]],["SRP000935","placeholder","Alternative splicing was profiled in Arabidopsis thaliana using Illumina-based RNA-seq.

The main limitation of this approach is that examples from both classes are required which might be infeasible in certain cases, especially those dealing with biological data. Such is the case for membrane-binding peripheral domains that play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking by reversibly binding to membranes. For these domains, a well-defined positive set is available with domains known to bind membrane along with a large unlabeled set of domains whose membrane binding affinities have not been measured. The aforementioned limitation can be addressed by a special class of semi-supervised machine learning called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning that uses a positive set with a large unlabeled set. METHODS In this study, we implement the first application of PU-learning to a protein function prediction problem: identification of peripheral domains. PU-learning starts by identifying reliable negative (RN) examples iteratively from the unlabeled set until convergence and builds a classifier using the positive and the final RN set. A data set of 232 positive cases and ~3750 unlabeled ones were used to construct and validate the protocol.Holdout evaluation of the protocol on a left-out positive set showed that the accuracy of prediction reached up to 95% during two independent implementations.These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains. Protocols like the one presented here become particularly useful in the case of availability of information from one class only.","Bhardwaj N, Gerstein M, Lu H."],["18423832","Highly integrated single-base resolution maps of the epigenome in Arabidopsis.","Cell","2008-May-2","SRA000286","Deciphering the multiple layers of epigenetic regulation that control transcription is critical to understanding how plants develop and respond to their environment. Using sequencing-by-synthesis technology we directly sequenced the cytosine methylome (methylC-seq), transcriptome (mRNA-seq), and small RNA transcriptome (smRNA-seq) to generate highly integrated epigenome maps for wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and mutants defective in DNA methyltransferase or demethylase activity. At single-base resolution we discovered extensive, previously undetected DNA methylation, identified the context and level of methylation at each site, and observed local sequence effects upon methylation state. Deep sequencing of smRNAs revealed a direct relationship between the location of smRNAs and DNA methylation, perturbation of smRNA biogenesis upon loss of CpG DNA methylation, and a tendency for smRNAs to direct strand-specific DNA methylation in regions of RNA-DNA homology. Finally, strand-specific mRNA-seq revealed altered transcript abundance of hundreds of genes, transposons, and unannotated intergenic transcripts upon modification of the DNA methylation state.","Lister R, O'Malley RC, Tonti-Filippini J, Gregory BD, Berry CC, Millar AH, Ecker JR."]],["SRP000568","no study abstract","Transcriptome sequencing of wildtype Arabidopsis plants (Col-0), and met1, drm1 drm2 cmt3, and ros1 dml2 dml3 null mutants using the Illumina Genetic Analyzer."],[["SRX002554","no description for experiment design","RNA-seq library construction protocol: Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with DNaseI (Qiagen) for 30 min at room temperature. following ethanol precipitation the 18S and 28S rRNA molecules were depleted from 20 �g of total RNA in three sequential Ribominus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) reactions as per manufacturer's instructions, using 6 plant-specific biotinylated LNA oligonucleotide rRNA probes supplied by (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

We compared simulation results for traditional capillary sequencing with \"Next Generation\" (NG) ultra high-throughput technologies. The simulation model was parameterized using mappings of 130,000 cDNA sequence reads to the Arabidopsis genome (NCBI Accession SRA008180.19). We also generated 454-GS20 sequences and de novo assemblies for the basal eudicot California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) and the magnoliid avocado (Persea americana) using a variety of methods for cDNA synthesis.The Arabidopsis reads tagged more than 15,000 genes, including new splice variants and extended UTR regions. Of the total 134,791 reads (13.8 MB), 119,518 (88.7%) mapped exactly to known exons, while 1,117 (0.8%) mapped to introns, 11,524 (8.6%) spanned annotated intron/exon boundaries, and 3,066 (2.3%) extended beyond the end of annotated UTRs. Sequence-based inference of relative gene expression levels correlated significantly with microarray data. As expected, NG sequencing of normalized libraries tagged more genes than non-normalized libraries, although non-normalized libraries yielded more full-length cDNA sequences. The Arabidopsis data were used to simulate additional rounds of NG and traditional EST sequencing, and various combinations of each. Our simulations suggest a combination of FLX and Solexa sequencing for optimal transcriptome coverage at modest cost. We have also developed ESTcalc http://fgp.huck.psu.edu/NG_Sims/ngsim.pl, an online webtool, which allows users to explore the results of this study by specifying individualized costs and sequencing characteristics.NG sequencing technologies are a highly flexible set of platforms that can be scaled to suit different project goals. In terms of sequence coverage alone, the NG sequencing is a dramatic advance over capillary-based sequencing, but NG sequencing also presents significant challenges in assembly and sequence accuracy due to short read lengths, method-specific sequencing errors, and the absence of physical clones. These problems may be overcome by hybrid sequencing strategies using a mixture of sequencing methodologies, by new assemblers, and by sequencing more deeply. Sequencing and microarray outcomes from multiple experiments suggest that our simulator will be useful for guiding NG transcriptome sequencing projects in a wide range of organisms.","Wall PK, Leebens-Mack J, Chanderbali AS, Barakat A, Wolcott E, Liang H, Landherr L, Tomsho LP, Hu Y, Carlson JE, Ma H, Schuster SC, Soltis DE, Soltis PS, Altman N, dePamphilis CW."]],["SRP000615","no study abstract","no study description"],[["SRX002936","no description for experiment design","no description for library construction","454 GS 20","Base Space","SRS002186",[["SRR014005","134,791","15,542,292","115"]]],["SRX002986","no description for experiment design","no description for library construction","454 GS 20","Base Space","SRS002202",[["SRR014399","170,486","19,836,781","116"],["SRR014400","134,452","15,646,892","116"],["SRR014414","510","58,499","114"],["SRR014415","1,723","198,907","115"],["SRR014416","3,679","423,620","115"],["SRR014417","6,559","765,446","116"]]],["SRX002987","no description for experiment design","no description for library construction","454 GS 20","Base Space","SRS002203",[["SRR014116","137,377","15,689,115","114"],["SRR014117","126,828","14,602,382","115"]]],["SRX002988","no description for experiment design","no description for library construction","454 GS 20","Base Space","SRS002203",[["SRR014118","140,901","15,962,545","113"],["SRR014119","171,016","19,499,884","114"]]]],[["SRS002186","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS002202","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS002203","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA008240",[["19066226","AGO1-miR173 complex initiates phased siRNA formation in plants.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","2008-Dec-23","SRA008240","MicroRNA (miRNA)-guided cleavage initiates entry of primary transcripts into the transacting siRNA (tasiRNA) biogenesis pathway involving RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6, DICER-LIKE4, and SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3.

Moreover, we demonstrate that accumulation of these smRNAs is often synergistically increased in ein5 abh1 double mutant plants, which suggests that these proteins act coordinately to regulate the substrates from which they are processed. Finally, we find that the parent transcripts of these novel smRNAs accumulate in an uncapped form upon loss of XRN4/EIN5.

The main limitation of this approach is that examples from both classes are required which might be infeasible in certain cases, especially those dealing with biological data. Such is the case for membrane-binding peripheral domains that play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking by reversibly binding to membranes. For these domains, a well-defined positive set is available with domains known to bind membrane along with a large unlabeled set of domains whose membrane binding affinities have not been measured. The aforementioned limitation can be addressed by a special class of semi-supervised machine learning called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning that uses a positive set with a large unlabeled set. METHODS In this study, we implement the first application of PU-learning to a protein function prediction problem: identification of peripheral domains. PU-learning starts by identifying reliable negative (RN) examples iteratively from the unlabeled set until convergence and builds a classifier using the positive and the final RN set. A data set of 232 positive cases and ~3750 unlabeled ones were used to construct and validate the protocol.Holdout evaluation of the protocol on a left-out positive set showed that the accuracy of prediction reached up to 95% during two independent implementations.These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains. Protocols like the one presented here become particularly useful in the case of availability of information from one class only.","Bhardwaj N, Gerstein M, Lu H."],["18423832","Highly integrated single-base resolution maps of the epigenome in Arabidopsis.","Cell","2008-May-2","SRA000286","Deciphering the multiple layers of epigenetic regulation that control transcription is critical to understanding how plants develop and respond to their environment.

At single-base resolution we discovered extensive, previously undetected DNA methylation, identified the context and level of methylation at each site, and observed local sequence effects upon methylation state.

The 3` RNA adapter (5`-pUCGUAUGCCGUCUUCUGCUUGidT-3`) possessed a 5` mono-phosphate and a 3` inverted deoxythymidine (idT). The smRNAs were first ligated to the 5` RNA adapter. The ligation products were gel eluted and ligated to the 3` RNA adapter. The final ligation products were then used as templates in a reverse transcription (RT) reaction using the RT-primer (5` - CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA - 3`) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This was followed by a limited (15 cycle) PCR amplification step using the PCR reverse (5`-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGA-3`) and forward (5`-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA-3`) primers and Phusion hot-start high fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Cambridge, MA). All oligonucleotides were provided by Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The amplification products were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer, eluted in 0.3 M NaCl rotating at room temperature for 4 hours, precipitated using ethanol, and resuspended in nuclease-free water.

Immediately following RNA precipitation, the flow through from the anion-exchange chromatography column was further precipitated in another 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol (smRNA fraction). The smRNA fraction was further purified by a phenol-chloroform extraction and an additional ethanol precipitation. Small RNAs were resolved by electrophoresis of 2.5 mg of the smRNA fraction and 7.5 mg of total RNA on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea in TBE buffer (45 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.0, and 1.0 mM EDTA). A gel slice containing RNAs of 15 to 35 nucleotides (based on the 10 base pair ladder size standard (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)) was excised and eluted in 0.3 M NaCl rotating at room temperature for 4 hours. The eluted RNAs were precipitated using ethanol and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated deionized water.
