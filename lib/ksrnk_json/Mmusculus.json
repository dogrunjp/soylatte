We describe here the transcriptional regulatory circuitry of ES cells that incorporates protein-coding and miRNA genes based on high-resolution ChIP-seq data, systematic identification of miRNA promoters, and quantitative sequencing of short transcripts in multiple cell types. We find that the key ES cell transcription factors are associated with promoters for miRNAs that are preferentially expressed in ES cells and with promoters for a set of silent miRNA genes. This silent set of miRNA genes is co-occupied by Polycomb group proteins in ES cells and shows tissue-specific expression in differentiated cells. These data reveal how key ES cell transcription factors promote the ES cell miRNA expression program and integrate miRNAs into the regulatory circuitry controlling ES cell identity.","Marson A, Levine SS, Cole MF, Frampton GM, Brambrink T, Johnstone S, Guenther MG, Johnston WK, Wernig M, Newman J, Calabrese JM, Dennis LM, Volkert TL, Gupta S, Love J, Hannett N, Sharp PA, Bartel DP, Jaenisch R, Young RA."]],["SRP001121","no study abstract","miRNA sequencing from murine embryonic stem cells (mES, v6.5), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), murine neural precursor cells (NPC), and ZHBT-c4 cells (from Austin Smith) untreated (0h), with 12 hours of doxycyclin treatment (12h), and with 24 hours of doxycyclin treatment (24h)."],[["SRX008325","no description for experiment design","Single-stranded cDNA libraries of short transcripts were generated using size selected RNA.

Here we show that tudor-domain containing 9 (Tdrd9) is essential for silencing Line-1 retrotransposon in the mouse male germline. Tdrd9 encodes an ATPase/DExH-type helicase, and its mutation causes male sterility showing meiotic failure. In Tdrd9 mutants, Line-1 was highly activated and piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) corresponding to Line-1 were increased, suggesting that feedforward amplification operates in the mutant. In fetal testes, Tdrd9 mutation causes Line-1 desilencing and an aberrant piRNA profile in prospermatogonia, followed by cognate DNA demethylation. TDRD9 complexes with MIWI2 with distinct compartmentalization in processing bodies, and this TDRD9-MIWI2 localization is regulated by MILI and TDRD1 residing at intermitochondrial cement.

Resting murine NK cells regulate the translation of effector molecule mRNAs (e.g., granzyme B, GzmB) through unclear molecular mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the translation of their mRNA targets, and are therefore candidates for mediating this control process. While the expression and importance of miRNAs in T and B lymphocytes have been established, little is known about miRNAs in NK cells. Here, we used two next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms to define the miRNA transcriptomes of resting and cytokine-activated primary murine NK cells, with confirmation by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and microarrays. We delineate a bioinformatics analysis pipeline that identified 302 known and 21 novel mature miRNAs from sequences obtained from NK cell small RNA libraries. These miRNAs are expressed over a broad range and exhibit isomiR complexity, and a subset is differentially expressed following cytokine activation. Using these miRNA NGS data, miR-223 was identified as a mature miRNA present in resting NK cells with decreased expression following cytokine activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-223 specifically targets the 3' untranslated region of murine GzmB in vitro, indicating that this miRNA may contribute to control of GzmB translation in resting NK cells. Thus, the sequenced NK cell miRNA transcriptome provides a valuable framework for further elucidation of miRNA expression and function in NK cell biology.","Fehniger TA, Wylie T, Germino E, Leong JW, Magrini VJ, Koul S, Keppel CR, Schneider SE, Koboldt DC, Sullivan RP, Heinz ME, Crosby SD, Nagarajan R, Ramsingh G, Link DC, Ley TJ, Mardis ER."]],["SRP001983","The goals of this study were to develop a method of sequencing smallRNA libraries from primary murine NK cells and perform bioinformatic analysis to identify known and novel microRNAs.  cDNA libraries were created from NK cell total RNA after size fractionationation and isolation of smallRNAs.  cDNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina and SOLiD, and analyzed with an in house bioinformatics pipeline.","This study evaluates the the expression of mature microRNAs in primary murine NK cell (splenic NK cells at rest and after IL-15 activaiton for 24 hours) using two different sequencing platforms: Illumina GA and SOLiD.

The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs.

Here we show that tudor-domain containing 9 (Tdrd9) is essential for silencing Line-1 retrotransposon in the mouse male germline. Tdrd9 encodes an ATPase/DExH-type helicase, and its mutation causes male sterility showing meiotic failure. In Tdrd9 mutants, Line-1 was highly activated and piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) corresponding to Line-1 were increased, suggesting that feedforward amplification operates in the mutant. In fetal testes, Tdrd9 mutation causes Line-1 desilencing and an aberrant piRNA profile in prospermatogonia, followed by cognate DNA demethylation. TDRD9 complexes with MIWI2 with distinct compartmentalization in processing bodies, and this TDRD9-MIWI2 localization is regulated by MILI and TDRD1 residing at intermitochondrial cement.

The best-characterized piRNAs mediate a conserved pathway that restricts transposable elements, and these frequently engage a \"ping-pong\" amplification loop. Certain stages of mammalian testis also accumulate abundant piRNAs of unknown function, which derive from noncoding RNAs that are depleted in transposable element content and do not engage in ping-pong.We report that the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of an extensive set of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are processed into piRNAs in Drosophila ovaries, murine testes, and Xenopus eggs. Analysis of different mutants and Piwi-class immunoprecipitates indicates that their biogenesis depends on primary piRNA components, but not most ping-pong components. Several observations suggest that mRNAs are actively selected for piRNA production for regulatory purposes. First, genic piRNAs do not accumulate in proportion to the level of their host transcripts, and many highly expressed transcripts lack piRNAs. Second, piRNA-producing mRNAs in Drosophila and mouse are enriched for specific gene ontology categories distinct from those of simply abundant transcripts. Third, the protein output of traffic jam, whose 3'UTR generates abundant piRNAs, is increased in piwi mutant follicle clones.We reveal a conserved primary piRNA pathway that selects and metabolizes the 3'UTRs of a broad set of cellular transcripts, probably for regulatory purposes.

The family of ADAR enzymes converts some adenosines of RNA duplexes to inosines through hydrolytic deamination. The adenosine recognition mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, to investigate it, we analyzed a set of selectively edited substrates with a cluster of edited sites. We used a large set of individual transcripts sequenced by the 454 sequencing technique. On average, we analyzed 570 single transcripts per edited region at four different developmental stages from embryogenesis to adulthood. To our knowledge, this is the first time, large-scale sequencing has been used to determine synchronous editing events. We demonstrate that edited sites are only coupled within specific distances from each other. Furthermore, our results show that the coupled sites of editing are positioned on the same side of a helix, indicating that the three-dimensional structure is key in ADAR enzyme substrate recognition.

The efficiency of editing for 28 different sites where analyzed during the development of the mouse brain from embryogenesis to adulthood. We show that with few exceptions the editing efficiency is low during embryogenesis, increasing gradually at different rates up to the adult mouse. The variation in editing give receptors like the Htr2c and the GABAA a different set of protein isoforms during the development than in the adult animal.

Also, it cannot distinguish whether one or both strands are being transcribed, for example with antisense transcripts reported to be associated with more than half of the genes in eukaryotes, or with overlapping genes that are abundant in compact genomes of prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. Here, we present a cDNA sequencing protocol that preserves information about a transcript%u2019s direction. Using S. cerevisiae and mouse brain transcriptomes as models, we demonstrate that knowing the transcript%u2019s orientation allows more accurate determination of the structure and expression of genes.

DNA methylation changes were measured using reduced representation bisulfite deep sequencing. Differential methylation was observed in approximately 700 and 1900 start and transcribed regions, respectively. The start regions showed bias toward decreased methylation. No bias was observed in the transcribed region. A comparison of absolute methylation levels in the control animals with treatment-related changes in methylation showed that baseline methylation levels play a role in determining which genes are methylated. Genes with low absolute methylation levels in the start region showed a trend toward increased As-related methylation and decreased expression. Genes with high levels of methylation in the transcribed region showed a trend toward decreased As-related methylation, but no change in expression. No overall correlation between treatment-related changes in methylation and expression was identified. Among genes showing differential methylation in the start region and differential expression, only 57% showed an inverse correlation. The results suggest that differential methylation following As treatment may only play a permissive role in regulating expression.

Deficiency or excess of MeCP2 causes severe neurological problems, suggesting that the number of molecules per cell must be precisely regulated. We quantified MeCP2 in neuronal nuclei and found that it is nearly as abundant as the histone octamer. Despite this high abundance, MeCP2 associates preferentially with methylated regions, and high-throughput sequencing showed that its genome-wide binding tracks methyl-CpG density. MeCP2 deficiency results in global changes in neuronal chromatin structure, including elevated histone acetylation and a doubling of histone H1. Neither change is detectable in glia, where MeCP2 occurs at lower levels. The mutant brain also shows elevated transcription of repetitive elements.

The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is believed to regulate transcriptional repression by catalysing the di- and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3). At present, it is unknown how the PcG proteins are recruited to their target promoters in mammalian cells. Here we show that PRC2 forms a stable complex with the Jumonji- and ARID-domain-containing protein, JARID2 (ref. 4). Using genome-wide location analysis, we show that JARID2 binds to more than 90% of previously mapped PcG target genes. Notably, we show that JARID2 is sufficient to recruit PcG proteins to a heterologous promoter, and that inhibition of JARID2 expression leads to a major loss of PcG binding and to a reduction of H3K27me3 levels on target genes.

Using Xenopus laevis as a model we demonstrate that Jarid2 knockdown impairs the induction of gastrulation genes in blastula embryos and results in failure of differentiation.

Initial sequencing method  development trials were carried out starting from 3 nanograms of ChIP DNA as follows. Samples were spiked with fluorescentlylabeled DNA oligonucleotides (GCGGTGACACGGGAGATCTGAACTCGTACT) that could then be used to monitor and calibrate tailing and blocking conditions across a range of DNA quantities (100 attomoles-5 femtomoles) ChIP DNA. Spiked samples were denatured at 95C for 5 minutes, and then snap-cooled on ice. After addition of terminal transferase (New England Biolabs), BSA and dATP, samples were incubated at 37C for 1 hour, followed by enzyme inactivation at 70C for 10 minutes. The blocking step was performed by another round of terminal transferase in the presence of 100 pmol ddTTP, incubating at 37C for 1 hour, followed by the enzyme inactivation. Tailing efficiency was then evaluated by using capillary electrophoresis (ABI 3730, Applied Biosystems) to determine the fraction of oligonucleotides that were tailed, and to evaluate the distribution of tail lengths. In this way, dATP:enzyme:template ratios that resulted in optimal tailing and blocking of ChIP DNA samples could be identified. The most effective condition used 4 U terminal transferase and 200 pmol dATP, yielding poly-A tails between 80 and 150 nucleotides in length. \n\nFollowing the above described methods which confirmed our ability to effectively tail and sequence small quantities of materials, 3 to 9 nanograms of ChIP DNA was tailed using the optimal tailing conditions described above. Tailed DNA samples were supplemented with 3' dideoxy-blocked oligonucleotide  (TCACTATTGTTGAGAACGTTGGCCTATAGTTCGTATTACGCGC\nGGTGACACGGGAGATCTGAACTCGTACTCACGddC) to minimize sample loss during\nhybridization. Samples were hybridized to the flowcells and single molecule sequencing-bysynthesis with reversible terminators3 was carried out using standard Heliscope procedures ('Helicos BioSciences Corporation'). We next explored other conditions and implementations to improve upon the procedure and to further reduce sample requirements. First, we experimented with additional carrier molecules. We used RNA oligoribonucleotides for this purpose as they are not a substrate for terminal transferase under the conditions employed here, and  therefore do not attach to the oligo-dT sequencing surface. We found that the addition of 2 pmols of oligoribonucleotide (CGUCAGGGCAGAGGAUGGAUGCAAGGAUAAGUGGA) stabilized the tailing reaction and allowed for addition of higher concentrations of enzyme (20 U) and dATP (400\npmols). We also used a second carrier approach involving DNA oligonucleotides  covalently attached to a solid surface (magnetic dynabeads, Invitrogen). In this approach, the carrier DNA oligonucleotide gets A-tailed along with the sample DNA, but can then be removed from the reaction prior to hybridization. We added 5ul of oligonucleotide-coated beads to the tailing reaction (after three washes in 1X terminal transferase buffer) including heat denatured ChIP DNA, 400pmol dATP and 20 units terminal transferase in 20ul volume. The blocking step was performed by adding 200pmol ddTTP and 20 units of terminal transferase. Incubation steps were performed as described above. The beads were removed by placing the reaction on a magnetic stand. These implementations enabled the analysis of as little as 50 picograms of ChIP DNA sample (as measured prior to A-tailing) which roughly corresponds to a two orders of magnitude reduction in sample requirements compared to existing standards, and was the lowest DNA amount that could be A-tailed, and still give sufficient aligned read numbers for ChIP.","Helicos HeliScope","Base Space","SRS006931",[["SRR029354","20,418,777","720,116,203","35"],["SRR029355","10,243,402","359,179,465","35"],["SRR029356","12,475,844","427,176,188","34"],["SRR029357","22,254,944","804,794,219","36"],["SRR029358","22,408,563","809,330,271","36"],["SRR029359","12,151,945","417,211,115","34"],["SRR029360","14,934,791","532,733,412","35"],["SRR029361","20,613,808","764,857,239","37"]]]],[["SRS006931","H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K27me3 and CTCF ChIP samples along with control input whole cell extract were produced from Mouse ES Cells (V6.5; male; genotype 129SvJaexC57BL/6; passages 10-15)",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA010240",[["19884257","Eset partners with Oct4 to restrict extraembryonic trophoblast lineage potential in embryonic stem cells.","Genes Dev","2009-Nov-1","SRA010240","The histone H3 Lys 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase Eset is an epigenetic regulator critical for the development of the inner cell mass (ICM).

However, the specific contribution of Jmjd3 induction and H3K27me3 demethylation to inflammatory gene expression remains unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing we found that Jmjd3 is preferentially recruited to transcription start sites characterized by high levels of H3K4me3, a marker of gene activity, and RNA polymerase II (Pol_II). Moreover, 70% of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible genes were found to be Jmjd3 targets. Although most Jmjd3 target genes were unaffected by its deletion, a few hundred genes, including inducible inflammatory genes, showed moderately impaired Pol_II recruitment and transcription. Importantly, most Jmjd3 target genes were not associated with detectable levels of H3K27me3, and transcriptional effects of Jmjd3 absence in the window of time analysed were uncoupled from measurable effects on this histone mark.

Jmjd3, a JmjC family histone demethylase (HDM), is quickly induced by the transcription factor NF-kB in response to inflammatory stimuli. Jmjd3 erases a histone mark associated with transcriptional repression and silencing, trimethylated lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27me3). Thus, Jmjd3-mediated demethylation of H3K27me3 links inflammation to the control of a histone modification involved in lineage determination, differentiation and tissue homeostasis. However, the specific contribution of Jmjd3 induction to innate immunity and inflammation remains unknown. Here we combined genome-wide mapping and gene knockout studies to investigate this issue. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to ultra high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in LPS-stimulated primary mouse macrophages demonstrated that Jmid3 is recruited to a large number of genomic targets with a strong preference for active transcription start sites (TSS). Virtually all Jmjd3-bound TSSs were characterized by high levels of H3K4me3, a marker of gene activity, and high levels of RNA polymerase II (Pol_II). Inducible genes showing a strong increase in H3K4me3 and Pol_II recruitment after endotoxin treatment (including those encoding several cytokines, chemokines and antiviral proteins) were in most cases Jmjd3-associated. In Jmjd3-knockout macrophages, initial RNA_Pol II recruitment and activation of Jmjd3 target genes was unaffected, but RNA_Pol II was prematurely released, thus resulting in non-sustained responses. Importantly, most Jmjd3 target genes were not associated with detectable levels of H3K27me3, and transcriptional effects of Jmjd3 absence in the window of time analyzed here were uncoupled from measurable effects on this histone mark. Our data indicate that Jmjd3 is the effector of an NF-kB-controlled feed-forward transcriptional loop pervasively sustaining inflammatory transcriptional responses in a manner that is independent of H3K27me3 demethylation, and suggest the possible use of anti-Jmjd3 drugs to dampen pathologic inflammation.\nOverall Design: Genome wide maps of histone demethylase jmjd3, the histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, and RNA-Polymerase II induction in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages of two types: (a) untreated and (b) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and interferon gamma to produce an inflammatory response."],[["SRX012918","no description for experiment design","ChIP experiments were carried out as described in (De Santa et al. 2007, PMID: 17825402).

However, only a few autosomal loci such as silent Hox gene clusters have been shown to lie in broad domains of repressive histone modifications. Here we present a ChIP-chip analysis of the repressive H3K27me3 histone modification along chr 17 in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells using an algorithm named broad local enrichments (BLOCs), which allows the identification of broad regions of histone modifications. Our results, confirmed by BLOC analysis of a whole genome ChIP-seq data set, show that the majority of H3K27me3 modifications form BLOCs rather than focal peaks. H3K27me3 BLOCs modify silent genes of all types, plus flanking intergenic regions and their distribution indicates a negative correlation between H3K27me3 and transcription. However, we also found that some nontranscribed gene-poor regions lack H3K27me3. We therefore performed a low-resolution analysis of whole mouse chr 17, which revealed that H3K27me3 is enriched in mega-base-pair-sized domains that are also enriched for genes, short interspersed elements (SINEs) and active histone modifications. These genic H3K27me3 domains alternate with similar-sized gene-poor domains. These are deficient in active histone modifications, as well as H3K27me3, but are enriched for long interspersed elements (LINEs) and long-terminal repeat (LTR) transposons and H3K9me3 and H4K20me3. Thus, an autosome can be seen to contain alternating chromatin bands that predominantly separate genes from one retrotransposon class, which could offer unique domains for the specific regulation of genes or the silencing of autonomous retrotransposons.","Pauler FM, Sloane MA, Huang R, Regha K, Koerner MV, Tamir I, Sommer A, Aszodi A, Jenuwein T, Barlow DP."]],["SRP000705","no study abstract","Genome wide chromatin maps have shown that spreading repressive histone modifications such as H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 are present on pericentromeric and telomeric repeats and on the inactive X chromosome where H3K27me3 or H3K9me3 alternately modify megabasepair sized domains.

Analysis of RNAPII occupancy uncovers distinct clusters of similarly regulated genes of different biological processes. PPARgamma:RXR binding is associated with the majority of induced genes, and sites are particularly abundant in the vicinity of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism.

Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours. More generally, the results establish reduced representation bisulphite sequencing as a powerful technology for epigenetic profiling of cell populations relevant to developmental biology, cancer and regenerative medicine.","Meissner A, Mikkelsen TS, Gu H, Wernig M, Hanna J, Sivachenko A, Zhang X, Bernstein BE, Nusbaum C, Jaffe DB, Gnirke A, Jaenisch R, Lander ES."]],["SRP000230","no study abstract","Genome-wide chromatin state maps of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, ES-derived neural progenitor cells and whole brain tissue.

Here, we have used data from single- and paired-end RNA-Seq and tiling arrays to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts in PolyA+ RNA from human and mouse tissues. Relative to tiling arrays, RNA-Seq identifies many fewer transcribed regions (\"seqfrags\") outside known exons and ncRNAs. Most nonexonic seqfrags are in introns, raising the possibility that they are fragments of pre-mRNAs. The chromosomal locations of the majority of intergenic seqfrags in RNA-Seq data are near known genes, consistent with alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site usage, promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts, or new alternative exons; indeed, reads that bridge splice sites identified 4,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes. Most of the remaining seqfrags correspond to either single reads that display characteristics of random sampling from a low-level background or several thousand small transcripts (median length = 111 bp) present at higher levels, which also tend to display sequence conservation and originate from regions with open chromatin. We conclude that, while there are bona fide new intergenic transcripts, their number and abundance is generally low in comparison to known exons, and the genome is not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported.","van Bakel H, Nislow C, Blencowe BJ, Hughes TR."]],["SRP000937","Several studies support that antisense-mediated regulation may affect a large proportion of genes.

The pellet was washed once with 750 ?l of 70% ethanol, dried on ice for 5 min and dissolved in 10 ?l of RNase free water.     Size selection  Size selection of fragmented RNA was achieved by denaturing urea-PAGE in a precast 6% TBE-urea gel (Invitrogen) at 200V for 1h. After staining with ethidium bromide, we excised the band corresponding to 200 nt and eluted in 300 ?l of SRA + 0.3M NaCl buffer (Illumina small RNA sample preparation kit) by incubation at room temperature for 4h with gentle agitation.

The 3’ adapter is modified at its 3’ end with an idT (inverted deoxythimidine) moiety, which renders it blocked in order to prevent further ligation reactions with any phosphorylated 5’ end. DMSO was added to the reaction to minimize any secondary structure formation in the RNA molecules. The reaction was set up as follows: 5.4 ?l sample, 0.6 ?l 3’ adapter (100 ??), 1 ?l 10 x T4 RNA ligase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.8, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM DTT), 1 ?l DMSO (Sigma), 1 ?l RNase out (Invitrogen), 20 U T4 RNA ligase (Invitrogen). The ligation reaction was performed at 20ºC for 6 h, followed by 15 min incubation at 65ºC to heat inactivate the T4 RNA ligase.

Thereafter, treatment was as described above for mycoplasma RNA.     Fragmentation of rRNA depleted total RNA  RNA was fragmented to sizes between 60-200 nt using the RNA Fragmentation Reagents kit (Ambion), based on metal-catalyzed heat fragmentation.

Relative to tiling arrays, RNA-Seq identifies many fewer transcribed regions (\"seqfrags\") outside known exons and ncRNAs. Most nonexonic seqfrags are in introns, raising the possibility that they are fragments of pre-mRNAs. The chromosomal locations of the majority of intergenic seqfrags in RNA-Seq data are near known genes, consistent with alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site usage, promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts, or new alternative exons; indeed, reads that bridge splice sites identified 4,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes. Most of the remaining seqfrags correspond to either single reads that display characteristics of random sampling from a low-level background or several thousand small transcripts (median length = 111 bp) present at higher levels, which also tend to display sequence conservation and originate from regions with open chromatin.

Our novel approach exploits the fact that inbred mice are homozygous at virtually every position in the genome to detect CNVs using a hidden Markov model (HMM). This HMM uses both the density of sequence reads mapped to the genome, and the rate of apparent heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms, to determine genomic copy number. We tested our algorithm on short read sequence data generated from re-sequencing chromosome 17 of the mouse strains A/J and CAST/EiJ with the Illumina platform. In total, we identified 118 copy number variants (43 for A/J and 75 for CAST/EiJ). We investigated the performance of our algorithm through comparison to CNVs previously identified by array-comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH).

Our novel approach exploits the fact that inbred mice are homozygous at virtually every position in the genome to detect CNVs using a hidden Markov model (HMM). This HMM uses both the density of sequence reads mapped to the genome, and the rate of apparent heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms, to determine genomic copy number. We tested our algorithm on short read sequence data generated from re-sequencing chromosome 17 of the mouse strains A/J and CAST/EiJ with the Illumina platform. In total, we identified 118 copy number variants (43 for A/J and 75 for CAST/EiJ). We investigated the performance of our algorithm through comparison to CNVs previously identified by array-comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). We performed quantitative-PCR validation on a subset of the calls that differed from the array CGH data sets.","Simpson JT, McIntyre RE, Adams DJ, Durbin R."],["19825173","Deep short-read sequencing of chromosome 17 from the mouse strains A/J and CAST/Ei identifies significant germline variation and candidate genes that regulate liver triglyceride levels.","Genome Biol","2009","ERA000077","Genome sequences are essential tools for comparative and mutational analyses.
