Often certain positions within the reads are inherently more likely to contain errors due to the protocols used to prepare the samples. Such biases can have adverse effects on both mapping rate and accuracy. To understand the relationship between potential protocol biases and poor mapping we wrote SAMstat, a simple C program plotting nucleotide overrepresentation and other statistics in mapped and unmapped reads in a concise html page. Collecting such statistics also makes it easy to highlight problems in the data processing and enables non-experts to track data quality over time.We demonstrate that studying sequence features in mapped data can be used to identify biases particular to one sequencing protocol. Once identified, such biases can be considered in the downstream analysis or even be removed by read trimming or filtering techniques.SAMStat is open source and freely available as a C program running on all Unix-compatible platforms.

Many loci are known to produce overlapping coding and noncoding RNAs with capped 5' ends that vary in size. Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region. Both of these methods allow further annotation-agnostic studies of the complex human transcriptome.","Plessy C, Bertin N, Takahashi H, Simone R, Salimullah M, Lassmann T, Vitezic M, Severin J, Olivarius S, Lazarevic D, Hornig N, Orlando V, Bell I, Gao H, Dumais J, Kapranov P, Wang H, Davis CA, Gingeras TR, Kawai J, Daub CO, Hayashizaki Y, Gustincich S, Carninci P."]],["DRP000169","Sequencing-based analysis of 5′ capped ends of RNAs have unveiled an unexpected complexity of the mammalian transcriptome, in which coding and non-coding RNAs produced in loci often harboring multiple promoters coexist with processed RNAs that exhibit a variety of 5′ modifications. In light of these discoveries, assessing whether novel transcription start sites (TSSs) are alternative promoters of known genes or promoters of newly identified transcripts require dedicated approaches. Furthermore, collecting such data from limiting amount of RNAs, such as microdissected cell types or from sub-cellular compartments with ex vivo samples—a necessary step to reduce the complexity of the studied transcriptome while keeping its biological relevance—often requires quantities of starting total RNA that are not sufficient for current protocols. Addressing both challenges, we developed nanoCAGE, a 5′ ends RNA profiling method of both poly-A+ and poly-A− transcripts that operates using as little as 10 ng of total RNA, coupled with CAGEscan, a technology for a gene-agnostic exploration of the transcriptome structure and dynamics, linking de novo-assembled transcripts to their regulatory regions","While the classic CAGE protocol requires a substantial number of biochemical processing steps, CAGEscan and nanoCAGE take advantage of a peculiar property of reverse transcriptase, called “template switching” to select 5′ ends of capped transcripts. This property allows proceeding directly from the first-strand cDNA synthesis to the addition of the second-strand cDNA primer at the 5′ end of the original RNA sequence without purification steps, thereby avoiding loss of material. This approach exploits the ability of the reverse-transcriptase to extend the cDNA using the mRNA’s cap as a template: the resulting neo-synthesized first strand cDNA carries one to three C nucleotides in correspondence of the cap structure. These Cs are hybridized to the ribo-G at the 3′ end of a template switching (TS) oligonucleotide. Then, the reverse transcriptase extends cDNA polymerization using the TS oligonucleotide as template, providing extra 3′ sequences to the first-strand cDNA. Due to the selectivity of the template switch for capped molecules, both protocols were used on total RNA, without depletion of ribosomal RNAs. Notably, the usage of 3′ random primer allows the detection of non-coding, non-polyadenylated RNAs. In the CAGEscan protocol, cDNAs are not cleaved, but directly prepared for sequencing by a second PCR which adds the adapter sequences needed to bridge PCR in the Illumina Genome Analyzers. In contrast with the nanoCAGE protocol, sequencing of both the 5′ end and the 3′ end of the template-switched captured cDNAs yields collections of 3′ ends reads “scanning” transcripts that can be unequivocally defined by their common 5′ end. Yet, unlike nanoCAGE libraries that contain uniformly short sequences, CAGEscan libraries are composed of sequences of broader size range including fragments longer than 1 kb, which poorly perform on currently available second-generation sequencing platform. However, since CAGEscan exclusively uses random primers at high concentration and commercial reverse transcriptases do not have a strong strand displacement activity, CAGEscan sequencing templates prepared by our optimized protocol are kept relatively short, regardless the length of the original mRNA molecules."],[["DRX000214","no description for experiment design","no description for library

Individual non-coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein-coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure. Deep sequencing of small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE (cap-analysis of gene expression) tags, which mark the 5' ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter-associated small RNAs, appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and non-coding genes, sometimes crossing exon-exon junctions. Here we show that processing of mature mRNAs through an as yet unknown mechanism may generate complex populations of both long and short RNAs whose apparently capped 5' ends coincide. Supplying synthetic promoter-associated small RNAs corresponding to the c-MYC transcriptional start site reduced MYC messenger RNA abundance.

We applied miRNA-, mRNA-, and ChIP-Seq to characterize the microRNome during lymphopoiesis within the context of the transcriptome and epigenome. We show that lymphocyte-specific miRNAs are either tightly controlled by polycomb group-mediated H3K27me3 or maintained in a semi-activated epigenetic state prior to full expression. Because of miRNA biogenesis, the cellular concentration of mature miRNAs does not typically reflect transcriptional changes. However, we uncover a subset of miRNAs for which abundance is dictated by miRNA gene expression. We confirm that concentration of 5p and 3p miRNA strands depends largely on free energy properties of miRNA duplexes. Unexpectedly, we also find that miRNA strand accumulation can be developmentally regulated. Our data provide a comprehensive map of immunity's microRNome and reveal the underlying epigenetic and transcriptional forces that shape miRNA homeostasis.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region.

The volume of water was reduced to 2 microl by centrifugal evaporation at room temperature in the presence of 0.66 M D- Threalose (Nacalai Tesque), 3.3 M D-Sorbitol (WAKO), 100 microM of TS oligonucleotide TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGCA(rG)(rG)(rG), 10 microM of random RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCTN15 (Stangegaard et al., 2006) or 10 microM of polythimine RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT18. The oligonucleotides were added at this step because it helps to keep the final reaction volume low. They contain binding sites for the type III restriction enzyme EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992), indicated in bold, that will be used to extract 5' tags from the cDNAs. Trehalose and sorbitol protect RNAs against degradation and capture on tube walls by preventing the samples from drying completely. Furthermore, these poly-hydroxylated molecules thermoactivate the reverse transcriptase (RTase) at the next step (Carninci et al., 1998). The mixture was then was heat-denatured at 65 deg_C for 10 min in a thermocycler (MWG) and transferred quickly on a ice/water mixture, to avoid the formation  of  secondary  structures.  Reverse transcription and template switching were accomplished together in a volume of 10 microl with the following components: 1.25 x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 650 nM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 1.3 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 925 mM betaine (Spiess and Ivell, 2002) (WAKO) , and 200 units of SuperScriptII (Invitrogen).

To prepare the second strand synthesis and amplification of the cDNAs, a small scale semi-suppressive PCR reaction was performed to evaluate the optimal number of cycles, defined as the last cycle before the intensity of the product ceases to increase. 10 microl aliquots were taken every two cycles and analyzed on 1% agarose gel. For each cDNA preparation, 2 microl of first strand cDNA were amplified in reactions of 100 microl using a mixture containing 1 x ExTaq Buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 100 nM forward PCR primer TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGC, 100 nM reverse PCR primer primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT, and 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa) with the following thermocycling program: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 15 s at 65 deg_C, 2 min at 68 deg_C) and using hot start.

The volume of water was reduced to 2 microl by centrifugal evaporation at room temperature in the presence of 0.66 M D- Threalose (Nacalai Tesque), 3.3 M D-Sorbitol (WAKO), 100 microM of TS oligonucleotide TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGCA(rG)(rG)(rG), 10 microM of random RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCTN15 (Stangegaard et al., 2006) or 10 microM of polythimine RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT18. The oligonucleotides were added at this step because it helps to keep the final reaction volume low. They contain binding sites for the type III restriction enzyme EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992), indicated in bold, that will be used to extract 5' tags from the cDNAs. Trehalose and sorbitol protect RNAs against degradation and capture on tube walls by preventing the samples from drying completely. Furthermore, these poly-hydroxylated molecules thermoactivate the reverse transcriptase (RTase) at the next step (Carninci et al., 1998). The mixture was then was heat-denatured at 65 deg_C for 10 min in a thermocycler (MWG) and transferred quickly on a ice/water mixture, to avoid the formation  of  secondary  structures.  Reverse transcription and template switching were accomplished together in a volume of 10 microl with the following components: 1.25 x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 650 nM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 1.3 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 925 mM betaine (Spiess and Ivell, 2002) (WAKO) , and 200 units of SuperScriptII (Invitrogen). The reactions were incubated at 22 deg_C for 10 min, 50 deg_C for 30 min, 75 deg_C for 15 min in a thermocycler., and then immediately transferred on a ice/water mix. To prepare the second strand synthesis and amplification of the cDNAs, a small scale semi-suppressive PCR reaction was performed to evaluate the optimal number of cycles, defined as the last cycle before the intensity of the product ceases to increase. 10 microl aliquots were taken every two cycles and analyzed on 1% agarose gel. For each cDNA preparation, 2 microl of first strand cDNA were amplified in reactions of 100 microl using a mixture containing 1 x ExTaq Buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 100 nM forward PCR primer TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGC, 100 nM reverse PCR primer primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT, and 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa) with the following thermocycling program: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 15 s at 65 deg_C, 2 min at 68 deg_C) and using hot start. The rest of the cDNAs (6 microl each) were then processed in 4 reactions of 100 microl with the chosen number of cycles. PCR products were pooled and cleaned using CTAB and GE Healthcare GFX purification columns (to be published elsewhere). Tags were prepared from 45 microl of cDNA by enzymatic cleavage in 100 microl using 100 units of EcoP15I (NEB), 1 x buffer 3 (NEB), 1 mM ATP (NEB) and 100 ng/microl BSA (NEB), at 37 deg_C for 4 hours. We chose EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992) for tag generation, as it was reported to cut 25/27 bases downstream its binding site (Matsumura et al., 2003). In addition its non-palindromic DNA binding site strongly reduces the opportunities for the formation of PCR primer dimers during subsequent steps. Reactions were mixed with 130 microl of TE buffer and the low molecular weight cleavage products were purified through the Microcon YM-100 membranes (Millipore) by spinning 15 min at 500 x g. The columns were filled again with 130 microl of TE buffer and spun 15 min at 500 x g. The flow-through was then concentrated on Microcon YM-10 (Millipore) by spinning 20 min at 12,000 x g. The low molecular weight cleavage products were recovered by spinning 3 min at 1000 x g after flipping the cartridges. Ligation adapters were annealed by mixing equimolar amounts of two oligonucleotides, NNAGCTGTAGAACTCTGAACCTGT and ACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGCT, in a thermocycler at 95 deg_C and left to cool down to room temperature. 1 pmol of adapters was ligated to 10 microl of the EcoP15I cleavage products in 20 microl of 0.5 x \"Mighty\" DNA ligation mixture (TaKaRa) overnight at 16 deg_C in a thermocycler with lid heater (MWG). Optimal number of cycles for the ligation product to be amplified was determined  by  PCR  with  5 microM  of  forward  PCR  primer AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAG, 5 microM of  reverse  PCR  primer CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGATAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAG, 1 x ExTaq buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa). The program was: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 10 s at 68 deg_C). 3 PCR reactions in 100 microl for each sample were performed. The excess of the primers was digested with 5 units of Exonuclease I (TaKaRa) at 37 deg_C for 30 min and then the enzyme was heat inactivated at 55 deg_C for 15 min. Then the PCR products were purified by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel and the band corresponding to the expected size (114 bp) was cut, passed through a syringe to break the structure of polyacrylamide, and the DNA was extracted at room temperature in a microtube on rotation with 800 microl of 1 x TE buffer over night. The tubes were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. 600 microl of 1 x TE buffer were added to the polyacrylamide in the microtube and let to rotate at room temperature for 1 hour. This step was repeated once more. Then for each sample, all the collected fractions were pooled together and passed through a Microspin filter (GE Healthcare) to eliminate residual traces of polyacrylamide.

Many loci are known to produce overlapping coding and noncoding RNAs with capped 5' ends that vary in size. Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region. Both of these methods allow further annotation-agnostic studies of the complex human transcriptome.","Plessy C, Bertin N, Takahashi H, Simone R, Salimullah M, Lassmann T, Vitezic M, Severin J, Olivarius S, Lazarevic D, Hornig N, Orlando V, Bell I, Gao H, Dumais J, Kapranov P, Wang H, Davis CA, Gingeras TR, Kawai J, Daub CO, Hayashizaki Y, Gustincich S, Carninci P."]],["DRP000169","Sequencing-based analysis of 5′ capped ends of RNAs have unveiled an unexpected complexity of the mammalian transcriptome, in which coding and non-coding RNAs produced in loci often harboring multiple promoters coexist with processed RNAs that exhibit a variety of 5′ modifications. In light of these discoveries, assessing whether novel transcription start sites (TSSs) are alternative promoters of known genes or promoters of newly identified transcripts require dedicated approaches. Furthermore, collecting such data from limiting amount of RNAs, such as microdissected cell types or from sub-cellular compartments with ex vivo samples—a necessary step to reduce the complexity of the studied transcriptome while keeping its biological relevance—often requires quantities of starting total RNA that are not sufficient for current protocols. Addressing both challenges, we developed nanoCAGE, a 5′ ends RNA profiling method of both poly-A+ and poly-A− transcripts that operates using as little as 10 ng of total RNA, coupled with CAGEscan, a technology for a gene-agnostic exploration of the transcriptome structure and dynamics, linking de novo-assembled transcripts to their regulatory regions","While the classic CAGE protocol requires a substantial number of biochemical processing steps, CAGEscan and nanoCAGE take advantage of a peculiar property of reverse transcriptase, called “template switching” to select 5′ ends of capped transcripts. This property allows proceeding directly from the first-strand cDNA synthesis to the addition of the second-strand cDNA primer at the 5′ end of the original RNA sequence without purification steps, thereby avoiding loss of material. This approach exploits the ability of the reverse-transcriptase to extend the cDNA using the mRNA’s cap as a template: the resulting neo-synthesized first strand cDNA carries one to three C nucleotides in correspondence of the cap structure. These Cs are hybridized to the ribo-G at the 3′ end of a template switching (TS) oligonucleotide. Then, the reverse transcriptase extends cDNA polymerization using the TS oligonucleotide as template, providing extra 3′ sequences to the first-strand cDNA. Due to the selectivity of the template switch for capped molecules, both protocols were used on total RNA, without depletion of ribosomal RNAs. Notably, the usage of 3′ random primer allows the detection of non-coding, non-polyadenylated RNAs. In the CAGEscan protocol, cDNAs are not cleaved, but directly prepared for sequencing by a second PCR which adds the adapter sequences needed to bridge PCR in the Illumina Genome Analyzers. In contrast with the nanoCAGE protocol, sequencing of both the 5′ end and the 3′ end of the template-switched captured cDNAs yields collections of 3′ ends reads “scanning” transcripts that can be unequivocally defined by their common 5′ end. Yet, unlike nanoCAGE libraries that contain uniformly short sequences, CAGEscan libraries are composed of sequences of broader size range including fragments longer than 1 kb, which poorly perform on currently available second-generation sequencing platform. However, since CAGEscan exclusively uses random primers at high concentration and commercial reverse transcriptases do not have a strong strand displacement activity, CAGEscan sequencing templates prepared by our optimized protocol are kept relatively short, regardless the length of the original mRNA molecules."],[["DRX000214","no description for experiment design","no description for library

The exon-intron structure of the coding sequence was correct for more than 95% of the clones with coding sequence annotation when we excluded cDNA clones insufficiently represented in the shotgun library due to PCR failure (42 out of 200 clones excluded), and the nucleotide-level accuracy of coding sequences of those correct clones was over 99.99%.

More recently, a majority of prostate cancers have been shown to harbor recurrent gene fusions of the androgen-regulated gene, TMPRSS2, to the oncogenic ETS transcription factor ERG.  Here we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to explore the genome-wide localization of these transcription factors in human prostate cancer cell lines as well as tissues.  Unexpectedly, transcriptional networks emanating from AR and ERG were found to be highly overlapping.  Furthermore, AR was found to regulate known 5’ fusion partners in prostate cancer including TMPRSS2, as well as negatively regulating its own expression.  While induced by androgen through fusion to TMPRSS2, ERG itself was shown to inhibit AR expression and positively regulate the genomic locus of wild-type ERG, thus revealing multiple levels of molecular cross-talk between AR and ERG.  Importantly, androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells in which ERG is overexpressed are able to proliferate and invade in the absence of androgen.  Thus, we dissected the intertwined genomic landscape of two master transcriptional regulators of prostate cancer and suggest a role for ERG in maintaining transcriptional networks necessary for androgen-independent prostate cancer growth.  These studies may suggest that future therapies against prostate cancer should target both AR and ERG, rather than AR alone, in order to achieve maximum effectiveness.\nOverall Design: ChIP_Seq examination of histone modifications and key transcription factors in LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cell lines in un-treated, vehicle treated or 10nM R1881 treated conditions.LNCaP ChIP-Seq experiments include samples GSM353609-GSM353618, GSM353625-GSM353628, GSM353633-GSM353635, GSM353641-GSM353644, and GSM353648.VCaP ChIP-Seq experiments include samples GSM353601-GSM353608, GSM353619-GSM353624, GSM353629-GSM353632, and GSM353645-GSM353647.In addition, we performed re-ChIP of AR and ERG in VCaP cells (GSM356767), and examined the effect of ERG knockdown on AR and ERG binding (samples GSM353636-GSM353639).To study ectopic ERG binding we performed ERG ChIP-Seq in stable RWPE+ERG or control cells (samples GSM353649-GSM353650).AR ChIP-Seq was also done in the AR-positive but ETS fusion-negative 22RV1 cells (GSM353640).To further study transcription factor binding and chromatin state we performed ChIP-Seq of AR, ERG, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and RNA Pol II in a metastatic prostate tumor tissue (samples GSM353651-GSM353656).To couple  the ChIP-Seq experiments with gene expression, we have also done Illumian SAGE-tag profiling in LNCaP cells following androgen treatment for 0, 24 and 48hrs. These DGE experiments correspond to samples GSM353657-GSM353659.Summary: \nAndrogen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the growth and development of the normal prostate and its malignant transformation.

suppressor genes. Differential miRNA expression has been reported to be of functional relevance for tumor biology. Using next-generation sequencing, the unbiased and absolute quantification of the small RNA transcriptome is now feasible. Neuroblastoma(NB) is an embryonal tumor with highly variable clinical course. We analyzed the small RNA transcriptomes of five favorable and five unfavorable NBs using SOLiD next-generation sequencing, generating a total of >188 000 000 reads. MiRNA expression profiles obtained by deep sequencing correlated well with real-time PCR data. Cluster analysis differentiated between favorable and unfavorable NBs, and the miRNA transcriptomes of these two groups were significantly different. Oncogenic miRNAs of the miR17-92 cluster and the miR-181 family were overexpressed in unfavorable NBs. In contrast, the putative tumor suppressive microRNAs, miR-542-5p and miR-628, were expressed in favorable NBs and virtually absent in unfavorable NBs. In-depth sequence analysis revealed extensive post-transcriptional miRNA editing. Of 13 identified novel miRNAs, three were further analyzed, and expression could be confirmed in a cohort of 70 NBs.","Schulte JH, Marschall T, Martin M, Rosenstiel P, Mestdagh P, Schlierf S, Thor T, Vandesompele J, Eggert A, Schreiber S, Rahmann S, Schramm A."]],["SRP001350","Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor with highly variable clinical courses.

We generated more than 100 million 36-base TSS-tag sequences and revealed comprehensive features of hypoxia responsive alterations in the transcriptional landscape of the human genome. The features include presence of inducible 'hot regions' in 54 genomic regions, 220 novel hypoxia inducible promoters that may drive non-protein-coding transcripts, 191 hypoxia responsive alternative promoters and detailed views of 120 novel as well as known hypoxia responsive genes. We further analyzed hypoxic response of different cells using additional 60 million TSS-tags and found that the degree of the gene-expression changes were different among cell lines, possibly reflecting cellular robustness against hypoxia.

We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions.

originate from the promoter and terminator regions of genes. Here we investigate transcription of fragments longer than 200 nucleotides, focusing on antisense transcription for known protein coding genes and intergenic transcription. We find that roughly 12% to 16% of all reads that originate from promoter and terminator regions, respectively, map antisense to the gene in question. Furthermore, we detect a high number of novel transcriptionally active regions (TARs) that are generally expressed at a lower level than protein coding genes. We find that the correlation between RNA-seq data and microarray data is dependent on the gene length, with longer genes showing a better correlation. We detect high antisense transcriptional activity from promoter, terminator and intron regions of protein-coding genes and identify a vast number of previously unidentified TARs, including putative novel EGFR transcripts. This shows that in-depth analysis of the transcriptome using RNA-seq is a valuable tool for understanding complex transcriptional events. Furthermore, the development of new algorithms for estimation of gene expression from RNA-seq data is necessary to minimize length bias.","Klevebring D, Bjursell M, Emanuelsson O, Lundeberg J."]],["SRP002338","We sequenced the transcriptome of three human cell lines used in the Human Protein Atlas program (http://www.proteinatlas.org).","no study description"],[["SRX019403","no description for experiment design","10 ug of total RNA was ribo-depleted using RiboMinus (Invitrogen) and used as input for the SOLiD Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit Rev C.","AB SOLiD System 3.0","Color Space","SRS059669",[["SRR040290","14,372,246","718,612,300","50"]]],["SRX019489","no description for experiment design","10 ug of total RNA was ribo-depleted using RiboMinus (Invitrogen) and used as input for the SOLiD Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit Rev C.","AB SOLiD System 3.0","Color Space","SRS059670",[["SRR040293","10,547,681","527,384,050","50"]]],["SRX019490","no description for experiment design","10 ug of total RNA was ribo-depleted using RiboMinus (Invitrogen) and used as input for the SOLiD Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit Rev C.","AB SOLiD System 3.0","Color Space","SRS059671",[["SRR040361","11,449,673","572,483,650","50"]]]],[["SRS059669","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS059670","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS059671","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA012315",[["20300190","Characterization of the Melanoma miRNAome by Deep Sequencing.","PLoS One","2010","SRA012315","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18-23 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence specific manner.

We examined genome-wide differences in transcription factor (TF) binding in several humans and a single chimpanzee by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. The binding sites of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and a key regulator of immune responses, nuclear factor kappaB (p65), were mapped in 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines, and 25 and 7.5% of the respective binding regions were found to differ between individuals. Binding differences were frequently associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants, and these differences were often correlated with differences in gene expression, suggesting functional consequences of binding variation. Furthermore, comparing PolII binding between humans and chimpanzee suggests extensive divergence in TF binding. Our results indicate that many differences in individuals and species occur at the level of TF binding, and they provide insight into the genetic events responsible for these differences.","Kasowski M, Grubert F, Heffelfinger C, Hariharan M, Asabere A, Waszak SM, Habegger L, Rozowsky J, Shi M, Urban AE, Hong MY, Karczewski KJ, Huber W, Weissman SM, Gerstein MB, Korbel JO, Snyder M."]],["SRP002126","no study abstract","Summary: We examined genome-wide variation in transcription factor binding in different individuals and a chimpanzee using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively-parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq).

We examined genome-wide differences in transcription factor (TF) binding in several humans and a single chimpanzee by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. The binding sites of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and a key regulator of immune responses, nuclear factor kappaB (p65), were mapped in 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines, and 25 and 7.5% of the respective binding regions were found to differ between individuals. Binding differences were frequently associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants, and these differences were often correlated with differences in gene expression, suggesting functional consequences of binding variation. Furthermore, comparing PolII binding between humans and chimpanzee suggests extensive divergence in TF binding. Our results indicate that many differences in individuals and species occur at the level of TF binding, and they provide insight into the genetic events responsible for these differences.","Kasowski M, Grubert F, Heffelfinger C, Hariharan M, Asabere A, Waszak SM, Habegger L, Rozowsky J, Shi M, Urban AE, Hong MY, Karczewski KJ, Huber W, Weissman SM, Gerstein MB, Korbel JO, Snyder M."]],["SRP002128","no study abstract","Summary: We examined genome-wide variation in transcription factor binding in different individuals and a chimpanzee using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively-parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq).

The sequencing of transcripts (RNA-Seq) should offer several advantages over microarray-based methods, including the ability to detect somatic mutations and accurately measure allele-specific expression. To investigate these advantages we have applied a novel, strand-specific RNA-Seq method to tumors and matched normal tissue from three patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas. Additionally, to better understand the genomic determinants of the gene expression changes observed, we have sequenced the tumor and normal genomes of one of these patients. We demonstrate here that our RNA-Seq method accurately measures allelic imbalance and that measurement on the genome-wide scale yields novel insights into cancer etiology. As expected, the set of genes differentially expressed in the tumors is enriched for cell adhesion and differentiation functions, but, unexpectedly, the set of allelically imbalanced genes is also enriched for these same cancer-related functions. By comparing the transcriptomic perturbations observed in one patient to his underlying normal and tumor genomes, we find that allelic imbalance in the tumor is associated with copy number mutations and that copy number mutations are, in turn, strongly associated with changes in transcript abundance. These results support a model in which allele-specific deletions and duplications drive allele-specific changes in gene expression in the developing tumor.","Tuch BB, Laborde RR, Xu X, Gu J, Chung CB, Monighetti CK, Stanley SJ, Olsen KD, Kasperbauer JL, Moore EJ, Broomer AJ, Tan R, Brzoska PM, Muller MW, Siddiqui AS, Asmann YW, Sun Y, Kuersten S, Barker MA, De La Vega FM, Smith DI."]],["SRP002009","no study abstract","Summary: RNA-Seq was applied to oral squamous cell carcinomas and matched normal oral tissue to measure gene expression patterns and identify examples of allelic imbalance.\nOverall Design: Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) and matched normal tissue from 3 patients."],[["SRX017073","no description for experiment design","SOLiD whole transcriptome (WT) protocol with total RNA extracted using Qiagen RNAeasy Mini Kit.

Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data.We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection.Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments.

A pair of common sequence tags was linked to all internal primers (Fi and Ri). Once these tag sequences were incorporated into PCR products in the first few amplification cycles, an exponential phase of the amplification could be carried out with a pair of communal primers, called superprimers, which can pair with the tag sequences. In the first round of amplification, only sequence-specific nested primers were used. The nested primers were then removed by exonuclease and the first-round PCR products were used as templates for a second round of amplification by adding communal primers and a mixture of fresh enzyme and dNTP.","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS007448",[["SRR030702","108,499","25,631,107","236"]]]],[["SRS007441","Human pan T cell receptor repertoire a/b cDNA sequences covering CDR3 regions",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007442","Human pan T cell receptor repertoire a/b cDNA sequences covering CDR3 regions sample 2",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007443","Human pan T cell receptor a/b repertoire sample 3",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007444","human regular T cell receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007445","human helper T cell 1 (Th1) receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007446","human helper T cell 2 (Th2) receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007447","human Cytotoxic T cell (Tc) receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007448","human naive T cell (Tn) receptor a/b receptor",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007449","human activated T cell (Ta) receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007450","human memory T cell (Tm) receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA010852",[["20064465","Genome-wide analysis of PTB-RNA interactions reveals a strategy used by the general splicing repressor to modulate exon inclusion or skipping.","Mol Cell","2009-Dec-25","SRA010852","Recent transcriptome analysis indicates that > 90% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, underscoring the contribution of differential RNA processing to diverse proteomes in higher eukaryotic cells.

Given a user-defined cutoff for the false discovery rate, TagDust identifies all reads explainable by combinations and partial matches to known sequences used during library preparation. We demonstrate the quality of our method on sequencing runs performed on Illumina's Genome Analyzer platform.Executables and documentation are available from http://genome.gsc.riken.jp/osc/english/software/.timolassmann@gmail.com.","Lassmann T, Hayashizaki Y, Daub CO."]],["SRP000228","The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched a public research consortium named ENCODE, the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements, in September 2003, to carry out a project to identify all functional elements in the human genome sequence.

We used a total of 251,933,381 short-read sequence tags generated from various types of transcriptome analyses in order to characterize 6039 iTSCs, which have significant expression levels. We analyzed and found that 23% of these iTSCs were located in the proximal regions of the RefSeq genes. These RefSeq-linked iTSCs showed similar expression patterns with the neighboring RefSeq genes, had widely fluctuating transcription start sites and lacked ordered nucleosome positioning. These iTSCs seemed not to form independent transcriptional units, simply representing the by-products of the neighboring RefSeq genes, in spite of their significant expression levels. Similar features were also observed for the TSCs located in the antisense regions of the RefSeq genes.

We generated more than 100 million 36-base TSS-tag sequences and revealed comprehensive features of hypoxia responsive alterations in the transcriptional landscape of the human genome. The features include presence of inducible 'hot regions' in 54 genomic regions, 220 novel hypoxia inducible promoters that may drive non-protein-coding transcripts, 191 hypoxia responsive alternative promoters and detailed views of 120 novel as well as known hypoxia responsive genes. We further analyzed hypoxic response of different cells using additional 60 million TSS-tags and found that the degree of the gene-expression changes were different among cell lines, possibly reflecting cellular robustness against hypoxia.

(ddbj). Despite being rich data sources, they have not been used much due to the difficulty in locating and analyzing datasets of interest.Geoseq http://geoseq.mssm.edu provides a new method of analyzing short reads from deep sequencing experiments. Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. It is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. The analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs. The ease of using Geoseq for these analyses suggests its utility and uniqueness as an analysis tool.","Gurtowski J, Cancio A, Shah H, Levovitz C, George A, Homann R, Sachidanandam R."],["19169241","Post-transcriptional processing generates a diversity of 5'-modified long and short RNAs.","Nature","2009-Feb-19","SRA008169","The transcriptomes of eukaryotic cells are incredibly complex. Individual non-coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein-coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure. Deep sequencing of small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE (cap-analysis of gene expression) tags, which mark the 5' ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter-associated small RNAs, appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and non-coding genes, sometimes crossing exon-exon junctions. Here we show that processing of mature mRNAs through an as yet unknown mechanism may generate complex populations of both long and short RNAs whose apparently capped 5' ends coincide. Supplying synthetic promoter-associated small RNAs corresponding to the c-MYC transcriptional start site reduced MYC messenger RNA abundance. The studies presented here expand the catalogue of cellular small RNAs and demonstrate a biological impact for at least one class of non-canonical small RNAs.","Affymetrix ENCODE Transcriptome Project; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ENCODE Transcriptome Project."]],["SRP000599","no study abstract","We report an applicaton of small RNA sequencing using high throughput next generation sequencing to identify the small RNA content of cell lines.

More than 20 million 25-base 5'-end tags were obtained from untreated and 5Aza-treated cells and matched to sequences within the human genome. Seventy three percent of the mapped unique tags were associated with RefSeq cDNA sequences, corresponding to approximately 14,000 different protein-coding genes in this single cell type. The level of expression of these genes ranged from 0.02 to 4,704 transcripts per cell. The sensitivity of a single sequence run of the SOLiD platform was 100-1,000 fold greater than that observed from 5'end SAGE data generated from the analysis of 70,000 tags obtained by Sanger sequencing.

Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts.

Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol as well as a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra high-throughput sequencing technology.

To assess technical variance within and between runs, we sequenced each sample seven times, split across two runs of the machine.
