Often certain positions within the reads are inherently more likely to contain errors due to the protocols used to prepare the samples. Such biases can have adverse effects on both mapping rate and accuracy. To understand the relationship between potential protocol biases and poor mapping we wrote SAMstat, a simple C program plotting nucleotide overrepresentation and other statistics in mapped and unmapped reads in a concise html page. Collecting such statistics also makes it easy to highlight problems in the data processing and enables non-experts to track data quality over time.We demonstrate that studying sequence features in mapped data can be used to identify biases particular to one sequencing protocol. Once identified, such biases can be considered in the downstream analysis or even be removed by read trimming or filtering techniques.SAMStat is open source and freely available as a C program running on all Unix-compatible platforms.

Many loci are known to produce overlapping coding and noncoding RNAs with capped 5' ends that vary in size. Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region. Both of these methods allow further annotation-agnostic studies of the complex human transcriptome.","Plessy C, Bertin N, Takahashi H, Simone R, Salimullah M, Lassmann T, Vitezic M, Severin J, Olivarius S, Lazarevic D, Hornig N, Orlando V, Bell I, Gao H, Dumais J, Kapranov P, Wang H, Davis CA, Gingeras TR, Kawai J, Daub CO, Hayashizaki Y, Gustincich S, Carninci P."]],["DRP000169","Sequencing-based analysis of 5′ capped ends of RNAs have unveiled an unexpected complexity of the mammalian transcriptome, in which coding and non-coding RNAs produced in loci often harboring multiple promoters coexist with processed RNAs that exhibit a variety of 5′ modifications. In light of these discoveries, assessing whether novel transcription start sites (TSSs) are alternative promoters of known genes or promoters of newly identified transcripts require dedicated approaches. Furthermore, collecting such data from limiting amount of RNAs, such as microdissected cell types or from sub-cellular compartments with ex vivo samples—a necessary step to reduce the complexity of the studied transcriptome while keeping its biological relevance—often requires quantities of starting total RNA that are not sufficient for current protocols. Addressing both challenges, we developed nanoCAGE, a 5′ ends RNA profiling method of both poly-A+ and poly-A− transcripts that operates using as little as 10 ng of total RNA, coupled with CAGEscan, a technology for a gene-agnostic exploration of the transcriptome structure and dynamics, linking de novo-assembled transcripts to their regulatory regions","While the classic CAGE protocol requires a substantial number of biochemical processing steps, CAGEscan and nanoCAGE take advantage of a peculiar property of reverse transcriptase, called “template switching” to select 5′ ends of capped transcripts. This property allows proceeding directly from the first-strand cDNA synthesis to the addition of the second-strand cDNA primer at the 5′ end of the original RNA sequence without purification steps, thereby avoiding loss of material. This approach exploits the ability of the reverse-transcriptase to extend the cDNA using the mRNA’s cap as a template: the resulting neo-synthesized first strand cDNA carries one to three C nucleotides in correspondence of the cap structure. These Cs are hybridized to the ribo-G at the 3′ end of a template switching (TS) oligonucleotide. Then, the reverse transcriptase extends cDNA polymerization using the TS oligonucleotide as template, providing extra 3′ sequences to the first-strand cDNA. Due to the selectivity of the template switch for capped molecules, both protocols were used on total RNA, without depletion of ribosomal RNAs. Notably, the usage of 3′ random primer allows the detection of non-coding, non-polyadenylated RNAs. In the CAGEscan protocol, cDNAs are not cleaved, but directly prepared for sequencing by a second PCR which adds the adapter sequences needed to bridge PCR in the Illumina Genome Analyzers. In contrast with the nanoCAGE protocol, sequencing of both the 5′ end and the 3′ end of the template-switched captured cDNAs yields collections of 3′ ends reads “scanning” transcripts that can be unequivocally defined by their common 5′ end. Yet, unlike nanoCAGE libraries that contain uniformly short sequences, CAGEscan libraries are composed of sequences of broader size range including fragments longer than 1 kb, which poorly perform on currently available second-generation sequencing platform. However, since CAGEscan exclusively uses random primers at high concentration and commercial reverse transcriptases do not have a strong strand displacement activity, CAGEscan sequencing templates prepared by our optimized protocol are kept relatively short, regardless the length of the original mRNA molecules."],[["DRX000214","no description for experiment design","no description for library

Individual non-coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein-coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure. Deep sequencing of small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE (cap-analysis of gene expression) tags, which mark the 5' ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter-associated small RNAs, appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and non-coding genes, sometimes crossing exon-exon junctions. Here we show that processing of mature mRNAs through an as yet unknown mechanism may generate complex populations of both long and short RNAs whose apparently capped 5' ends coincide. Supplying synthetic promoter-associated small RNAs corresponding to the c-MYC transcriptional start site reduced MYC messenger RNA abundance.

We applied miRNA-, mRNA-, and ChIP-Seq to characterize the microRNome during lymphopoiesis within the context of the transcriptome and epigenome. We show that lymphocyte-specific miRNAs are either tightly controlled by polycomb group-mediated H3K27me3 or maintained in a semi-activated epigenetic state prior to full expression. Because of miRNA biogenesis, the cellular concentration of mature miRNAs does not typically reflect transcriptional changes. However, we uncover a subset of miRNAs for which abundance is dictated by miRNA gene expression. We confirm that concentration of 5p and 3p miRNA strands depends largely on free energy properties of miRNA duplexes. Unexpectedly, we also find that miRNA strand accumulation can be developmentally regulated. Our data provide a comprehensive map of immunity's microRNome and reveal the underlying epigenetic and transcriptional forces that shape miRNA homeostasis.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region.

The volume of water was reduced to 2 microl by centrifugal evaporation at room temperature in the presence of 0.66 M D- Threalose (Nacalai Tesque), 3.3 M D-Sorbitol (WAKO), 100 microM of TS oligonucleotide TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGCA(rG)(rG)(rG), 10 microM of random RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCTN15 (Stangegaard et al., 2006) or 10 microM of polythimine RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT18. The oligonucleotides were added at this step because it helps to keep the final reaction volume low. They contain binding sites for the type III restriction enzyme EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992), indicated in bold, that will be used to extract 5' tags from the cDNAs. Trehalose and sorbitol protect RNAs against degradation and capture on tube walls by preventing the samples from drying completely. Furthermore, these poly-hydroxylated molecules thermoactivate the reverse transcriptase (RTase) at the next step (Carninci et al., 1998). The mixture was then was heat-denatured at 65 deg_C for 10 min in a thermocycler (MWG) and transferred quickly on a ice/water mixture, to avoid the formation  of  secondary  structures.  Reverse transcription and template switching were accomplished together in a volume of 10 microl with the following components: 1.25 x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 650 nM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 1.3 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 925 mM betaine (Spiess and Ivell, 2002) (WAKO) , and 200 units of SuperScriptII (Invitrogen).

To prepare the second strand synthesis and amplification of the cDNAs, a small scale semi-suppressive PCR reaction was performed to evaluate the optimal number of cycles, defined as the last cycle before the intensity of the product ceases to increase. 10 microl aliquots were taken every two cycles and analyzed on 1% agarose gel. For each cDNA preparation, 2 microl of first strand cDNA were amplified in reactions of 100 microl using a mixture containing 1 x ExTaq Buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 100 nM forward PCR primer TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGC, 100 nM reverse PCR primer primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT, and 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa) with the following thermocycling program: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 15 s at 65 deg_C, 2 min at 68 deg_C) and using hot start.

The volume of water was reduced to 2 microl by centrifugal evaporation at room temperature in the presence of 0.66 M D- Threalose (Nacalai Tesque), 3.3 M D-Sorbitol (WAKO), 100 microM of TS oligonucleotide TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGCA(rG)(rG)(rG), 10 microM of random RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCTN15 (Stangegaard et al., 2006) or 10 microM of polythimine RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT18. The oligonucleotides were added at this step because it helps to keep the final reaction volume low. They contain binding sites for the type III restriction enzyme EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992), indicated in bold, that will be used to extract 5' tags from the cDNAs. Trehalose and sorbitol protect RNAs against degradation and capture on tube walls by preventing the samples from drying completely. Furthermore, these poly-hydroxylated molecules thermoactivate the reverse transcriptase (RTase) at the next step (Carninci et al., 1998). The mixture was then was heat-denatured at 65 deg_C for 10 min in a thermocycler (MWG) and transferred quickly on a ice/water mixture, to avoid the formation  of  secondary  structures.  Reverse transcription and template switching were accomplished together in a volume of 10 microl with the following components: 1.25 x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 650 nM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 1.3 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 925 mM betaine (Spiess and Ivell, 2002) (WAKO) , and 200 units of SuperScriptII (Invitrogen). The reactions were incubated at 22 deg_C for 10 min, 50 deg_C for 30 min, 75 deg_C for 15 min in a thermocycler., and then immediately transferred on a ice/water mix. To prepare the second strand synthesis and amplification of the cDNAs, a small scale semi-suppressive PCR reaction was performed to evaluate the optimal number of cycles, defined as the last cycle before the intensity of the product ceases to increase. 10 microl aliquots were taken every two cycles and analyzed on 1% agarose gel. For each cDNA preparation, 2 microl of first strand cDNA were amplified in reactions of 100 microl using a mixture containing 1 x ExTaq Buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 100 nM forward PCR primer TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGC, 100 nM reverse PCR primer primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT, and 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa) with the following thermocycling program: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 15 s at 65 deg_C, 2 min at 68 deg_C) and using hot start. The rest of the cDNAs (6 microl each) were then processed in 4 reactions of 100 microl with the chosen number of cycles. PCR products were pooled and cleaned using CTAB and GE Healthcare GFX purification columns (to be published elsewhere). Tags were prepared from 45 microl of cDNA by enzymatic cleavage in 100 microl using 100 units of EcoP15I (NEB), 1 x buffer 3 (NEB), 1 mM ATP (NEB) and 100 ng/microl BSA (NEB), at 37 deg_C for 4 hours. We chose EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992) for tag generation, as it was reported to cut 25/27 bases downstream its binding site (Matsumura et al., 2003). In addition its non-palindromic DNA binding site strongly reduces the opportunities for the formation of PCR primer dimers during subsequent steps. Reactions were mixed with 130 microl of TE buffer and the low molecular weight cleavage products were purified through the Microcon YM-100 membranes (Millipore) by spinning 15 min at 500 x g. The columns were filled again with 130 microl of TE buffer and spun 15 min at 500 x g. The flow-through was then concentrated on Microcon YM-10 (Millipore) by spinning 20 min at 12,000 x g. The low molecular weight cleavage products were recovered by spinning 3 min at 1000 x g after flipping the cartridges. Ligation adapters were annealed by mixing equimolar amounts of two oligonucleotides, NNAGCTGTAGAACTCTGAACCTGT and ACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGCT, in a thermocycler at 95 deg_C and left to cool down to room temperature. 1 pmol of adapters was ligated to 10 microl of the EcoP15I cleavage products in 20 microl of 0.5 x \"Mighty\" DNA ligation mixture (TaKaRa) overnight at 16 deg_C in a thermocycler with lid heater (MWG). Optimal number of cycles for the ligation product to be amplified was determined  by  PCR  with  5 microM  of  forward  PCR  primer AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAG, 5 microM of  reverse  PCR  primer CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGATAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAG, 1 x ExTaq buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa). The program was: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 10 s at 68 deg_C). 3 PCR reactions in 100 microl for each sample were performed. The excess of the primers was digested with 5 units of Exonuclease I (TaKaRa) at 37 deg_C for 30 min and then the enzyme was heat inactivated at 55 deg_C for 15 min. Then the PCR products were purified by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel and the band corresponding to the expected size (114 bp) was cut, passed through a syringe to break the structure of polyacrylamide, and the DNA was extracted at room temperature in a microtube on rotation with 800 microl of 1 x TE buffer over night. The tubes were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. 600 microl of 1 x TE buffer were added to the polyacrylamide in the microtube and let to rotate at room temperature for 1 hour. This step was repeated once more. Then for each sample, all the collected fractions were pooled together and passed through a Microspin filter (GE Healthcare) to eliminate residual traces of polyacrylamide.

Many loci are known to produce overlapping coding and noncoding RNAs with capped 5' ends that vary in size. Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region. Both of these methods allow further annotation-agnostic studies of the complex human transcriptome.","Plessy C, Bertin N, Takahashi H, Simone R, Salimullah M, Lassmann T, Vitezic M, Severin J, Olivarius S, Lazarevic D, Hornig N, Orlando V, Bell I, Gao H, Dumais J, Kapranov P, Wang H, Davis CA, Gingeras TR, Kawai J, Daub CO, Hayashizaki Y, Gustincich S, Carninci P."]],["DRP000169","Sequencing-based analysis of 5′ capped ends of RNAs have unveiled an unexpected complexity of the mammalian transcriptome, in which coding and non-coding RNAs produced in loci often harboring multiple promoters coexist with processed RNAs that exhibit a variety of 5′ modifications. In light of these discoveries, assessing whether novel transcription start sites (TSSs) are alternative promoters of known genes or promoters of newly identified transcripts require dedicated approaches. Furthermore, collecting such data from limiting amount of RNAs, such as microdissected cell types or from sub-cellular compartments with ex vivo samples—a necessary step to reduce the complexity of the studied transcriptome while keeping its biological relevance—often requires quantities of starting total RNA that are not sufficient for current protocols. Addressing both challenges, we developed nanoCAGE, a 5′ ends RNA profiling method of both poly-A+ and poly-A− transcripts that operates using as little as 10 ng of total RNA, coupled with CAGEscan, a technology for a gene-agnostic exploration of the transcriptome structure and dynamics, linking de novo-assembled transcripts to their regulatory regions","While the classic CAGE protocol requires a substantial number of biochemical processing steps, CAGEscan and nanoCAGE take advantage of a peculiar property of reverse transcriptase, called “template switching” to select 5′ ends of capped transcripts. This property allows proceeding directly from the first-strand cDNA synthesis to the addition of the second-strand cDNA primer at the 5′ end of the original RNA sequence without purification steps, thereby avoiding loss of material. This approach exploits the ability of the reverse-transcriptase to extend the cDNA using the mRNA’s cap as a template: the resulting neo-synthesized first strand cDNA carries one to three C nucleotides in correspondence of the cap structure. These Cs are hybridized to the ribo-G at the 3′ end of a template switching (TS) oligonucleotide. Then, the reverse transcriptase extends cDNA polymerization using the TS oligonucleotide as template, providing extra 3′ sequences to the first-strand cDNA. Due to the selectivity of the template switch for capped molecules, both protocols were used on total RNA, without depletion of ribosomal RNAs. Notably, the usage of 3′ random primer allows the detection of non-coding, non-polyadenylated RNAs. In the CAGEscan protocol, cDNAs are not cleaved, but directly prepared for sequencing by a second PCR which adds the adapter sequences needed to bridge PCR in the Illumina Genome Analyzers. In contrast with the nanoCAGE protocol, sequencing of both the 5′ end and the 3′ end of the template-switched captured cDNAs yields collections of 3′ ends reads “scanning” transcripts that can be unequivocally defined by their common 5′ end. Yet, unlike nanoCAGE libraries that contain uniformly short sequences, CAGEscan libraries are composed of sequences of broader size range including fragments longer than 1 kb, which poorly perform on currently available second-generation sequencing platform. However, since CAGEscan exclusively uses random primers at high concentration and commercial reverse transcriptases do not have a strong strand displacement activity, CAGEscan sequencing templates prepared by our optimized protocol are kept relatively short, regardless the length of the original mRNA molecules."],[["DRX000214","no description for experiment design","no description for library

The exon-intron structure of the coding sequence was correct for more than 95% of the clones with coding sequence annotation when we excluded cDNA clones insufficiently represented in the shotgun library due to PCR failure (42 out of 200 clones excluded), and the nucleotide-level accuracy of coding sequences of those correct clones was over 99.99%.

More recently, a majority of prostate cancers have been shown to harbor recurrent gene fusions of the androgen-regulated gene, TMPRSS2, to the oncogenic ETS transcription factor ERG.  Here we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to explore the genome-wide localization of these transcription factors in human prostate cancer cell lines as well as tissues.  Unexpectedly, transcriptional networks emanating from AR and ERG were found to be highly overlapping.  Furthermore, AR was found to regulate known 5’ fusion partners in prostate cancer including TMPRSS2, as well as negatively regulating its own expression.  While induced by androgen through fusion to TMPRSS2, ERG itself was shown to inhibit AR expression and positively regulate the genomic locus of wild-type ERG, thus revealing multiple levels of molecular cross-talk between AR and ERG.  Importantly, androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells in which ERG is overexpressed are able to proliferate and invade in the absence of androgen.  Thus, we dissected the intertwined genomic landscape of two master transcriptional regulators of prostate cancer and suggest a role for ERG in maintaining transcriptional networks necessary for androgen-independent prostate cancer growth.  These studies may suggest that future therapies against prostate cancer should target both AR and ERG, rather than AR alone, in order to achieve maximum effectiveness.\nOverall Design: ChIP_Seq examination of histone modifications and key transcription factors in LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cell lines in un-treated, vehicle treated or 10nM R1881 treated conditions.LNCaP ChIP-Seq experiments include samples GSM353609-GSM353618, GSM353625-GSM353628, GSM353633-GSM353635, GSM353641-GSM353644, and GSM353648.VCaP ChIP-Seq experiments include samples GSM353601-GSM353608, GSM353619-GSM353624, GSM353629-GSM353632, and GSM353645-GSM353647.In addition, we performed re-ChIP of AR and ERG in VCaP cells (GSM356767), and examined the effect of ERG knockdown on AR and ERG binding (samples GSM353636-GSM353639).To study ectopic ERG binding we performed ERG ChIP-Seq in stable RWPE+ERG or control cells (samples GSM353649-GSM353650).AR ChIP-Seq was also done in the AR-positive but ETS fusion-negative 22RV1 cells (GSM353640).To further study transcription factor binding and chromatin state we performed ChIP-Seq of AR, ERG, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and RNA Pol II in a metastatic prostate tumor tissue (samples GSM353651-GSM353656).To couple  the ChIP-Seq experiments with gene expression, we have also done Illumian SAGE-tag profiling in LNCaP cells following androgen treatment for 0, 24 and 48hrs.

suppressor genes. Differential miRNA expression has been reported to be of functional relevance for tumor biology. Using next-generation sequencing, the unbiased and absolute quantification of the small RNA transcriptome is now feasible. Neuroblastoma(NB) is an embryonal tumor with highly variable clinical course. We analyzed the small RNA transcriptomes of five favorable and five unfavorable NBs using SOLiD next-generation sequencing, generating a total of >188 000 000 reads. MiRNA expression profiles obtained by deep sequencing correlated well with real-time PCR data. Cluster analysis differentiated between favorable and unfavorable NBs, and the miRNA transcriptomes of these two groups were significantly different. Oncogenic miRNAs of the miR17-92 cluster and the miR-181 family were overexpressed in unfavorable NBs. In contrast, the putative tumor suppressive microRNAs, miR-542-5p and miR-628, were expressed in favorable NBs and virtually absent in unfavorable NBs. In-depth sequence analysis revealed extensive post-transcriptional miRNA editing. Of 13 identified novel miRNAs, three were further analyzed, and expression could be confirmed in a cohort of 70 NBs.","Schulte JH, Marschall T, Martin M, Rosenstiel P, Mestdagh P, Schlierf S, Thor T, Vandesompele J, Eggert A, Schreiber S, Rahmann S, Schramm A."]],["SRP001350","Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor with highly variable clinical courses.

We applied this method to observe gene-expression changes in a colon cancer cell line cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We generated more than 100 million 36-base TSS-tag sequences and revealed comprehensive features of hypoxia responsive alterations in the transcriptional landscape of the human genome. The features include presence of inducible 'hot regions' in 54 genomic regions, 220 novel hypoxia inducible promoters that may drive non-protein-coding transcripts, 191 hypoxia responsive alternative promoters and detailed views of 120 novel as well as known hypoxia responsive genes. We further analyzed hypoxic response of different cells using additional 60 million TSS-tags and found that the degree of the gene-expression changes were different among cell lines, possibly reflecting cellular robustness against hypoxia. The novel dynamic figure of the human gene transcriptome will deepen our understanding of the transcriptional program of the human genome as well as bringing new insights into the biology of cancer

We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions.

lines.","PLoS One","2010","SRA012517","Several recent studies have indicated that transcription is pervasive in regions outside of protein coding genes and that short antisense transcripts can originate from the promoter and terminator regions of genes. Here we investigate transcription of fragments longer than 200 nucleotides, focusing on antisense transcription for known protein coding genes and intergenic transcription. We find that roughly 12% to 16% of all reads that originate from promoter and terminator regions, respectively, map antisense to the gene in question. Furthermore, we detect a high number of novel transcriptionally active regions (TARs) that are generally expressed at a lower level than protein coding genes. We find that the correlation between RNA-seq data and microarray data is dependent on the gene length, with longer genes showing a better correlation. We detect high antisense transcriptional activity from promoter, terminator and intron regions of protein-coding genes and identify a vast number of previously unidentified TARs, including putative novel EGFR transcripts. This shows that in-depth analysis of the transcriptome using RNA-seq is a valuable tool for understanding complex transcriptional events. Furthermore, the development of new algorithms for estimation of gene expression from RNA-seq data is necessary to minimize length bias.","Klevebring D, Bjursell M, Emanuelsson O, Lundeberg J."]],["SRP002338","We sequenced the transcriptome of three human cell lines used in the Human Protein Atlas program (http://www.proteinatlas.org).","no study description"],[["SRX019403","no description for experiment design","10 ug of total RNA was ribo-depleted using RiboMinus (Invitrogen) and used as input for the SOLiD Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit Rev C.","AB SOLiD System 3.0","Color Space","SRS059669",[["SRR040290","14,372,246","718,612,300","50"]]],["SRX019489","no description for experiment design","10 ug of total RNA was ribo-depleted using RiboMinus (Invitrogen) and used as input for the SOLiD Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit Rev C.","AB SOLiD System 3.0","Color Space","SRS059670",[["SRR040293","10,547,681","527,384,050","50"]]],["SRX019490","no description for experiment design","10 ug of total RNA was ribo-depleted using RiboMinus (Invitrogen) and used as input for the SOLiD Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit Rev C.","AB SOLiD System 3.0","Color Space","SRS059671",[["SRR040361","11,449,673","572,483,650","50"]]]],[["SRS059669","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS059670","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS059671","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA012315",[["20300190","Characterization of the Melanoma miRNAome by Deep Sequencing.","PLoS One","2010","SRA012315","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18-23 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence specific manner.

We therefore undertook a comprehensive analysis of the miRNAome in a diverse range of pigment cells including: melanoblasts, melanocytes, congenital nevocytes, acral, mucosal, cutaneous and uveal melanoma cells. We sequenced 12 small RNA libraries using Illumina's GAII platform. This massively parallel sequencing approach revealed a total of 539 known mature and mature-star sequences, along with the prediction of 389 novel miRNA candidates. Using the relative proportion of the total unique read counts against total number of reads, hierarchal clustering of all novel candidates plus known miRNAs gave good separation of the different histological subtypes. Some of the novel miRNAs may be specific to the melanocytic lineage and as such could be used as biomarkers to assist in the early detection of distant metastasises by measuring the circulating levels in blood. Follow up studies of the functional roles of these pigment cell miRNAs and the identification of their targets should shed further light on their role in the development and progression of melanoma.\nOverall Design: Illumina GAII deep sequencing of 12 melanoma and pigment cell lines"],[["SRX018396","no description for experiment design","The small RNA libraries were constructed using a

Binding differences were frequently associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants, and these differences were often correlated with differences in gene expression, suggesting functional consequences of binding variation.

We examined genome-wide differences in transcription factor (TF) binding in several humans and a single chimpanzee by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. The binding sites of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and a key regulator of immune responses, nuclear factor kappaB (p65), were mapped in 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines, and 25 and 7.5% of the respective binding regions were found to differ between individuals. Binding differences were frequently associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants, and these differences were often correlated with differences in gene expression, suggesting functional consequences of binding variation. Furthermore, comparing PolII binding between humans and chimpanzee suggests extensive divergence in TF binding. Our results indicate that many differences in individuals and species occur at the level of TF binding, and they provide insight into the genetic events responsible for these differences.","Kasowski M, Grubert F, Heffelfinger C, Hariharan M, Asabere A, Waszak SM, Habegger L, Rozowsky J, Shi M, Urban AE, Hong MY, Karczewski KJ, Huber W, Weissman SM, Gerstein MB, Korbel JO, Snyder M."]],["SRP002128","no study abstract","Summary: We examined genome-wide variation in transcription factor binding in different individuals and a chimpanzee using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively-parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq).

The sequencing of transcripts (RNA-Seq) should offer several advantages over microarray-based methods, including the ability to detect somatic mutations and accurately measure allele-specific expression. To investigate these advantages we have applied a novel, strand-specific RNA-Seq method to tumors and matched normal tissue from three patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas. Additionally, to better understand the genomic determinants of the gene expression changes observed, we have sequenced the tumor and normal genomes of one of these patients. We demonstrate here that our RNA-Seq method accurately measures allelic imbalance and that measurement on the genome-wide scale yields novel insights into cancer etiology. As expected, the set of genes differentially expressed in the tumors is enriched for cell adhesion and differentiation functions, but, unexpectedly, the set of allelically imbalanced genes is also enriched for these same cancer-related functions. By comparing the transcriptomic perturbations observed in one patient to his underlying normal and tumor genomes, we find that allelic imbalance in the tumor is associated with copy number mutations and that copy number mutations are, in turn, strongly associated with changes in transcript abundance. These results support a model in which allele-specific deletions and duplications drive allele-specific changes in gene expression in the developing tumor.","Tuch BB, Laborde RR, Xu X, Gu J, Chung CB, Monighetti CK, Stanley SJ, Olsen KD, Kasperbauer JL, Moore EJ, Broomer AJ, Tan R, Brzoska PM, Muller MW, Siddiqui AS, Asmann YW, Sun Y, Kuersten S, Barker MA, De La Vega FM, Smith DI."]],["SRP002009","no study abstract","Summary: RNA-Seq was applied to oral squamous cell carcinomas and matched normal oral tissue to measure gene expression patterns and identify examples of allelic imbalance.\nOverall Design: Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) and matched normal tissue from 3 patients."],[["SRX017073","no description for experiment design","SOLiD whole transcriptome (WT) protocol with total RNA extracted using Qiagen RNAeasy Mini Kit.

Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data.We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection.Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments.

A pair of common sequence tags was linked to all internal primers (Fi and Ri). Once these tag sequences were incorporated into PCR products in the first few amplification cycles, an exponential phase of the amplification could be carried out with a pair of communal primers, called superprimers, which can pair with the tag sequences. In the first round of amplification, only sequence-specific nested primers were used. The nested primers were then removed by exonuclease and the first-round PCR products were used as templates for a second round of amplification by adding communal primers and a mixture of fresh enzyme and dNTP.","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS007448",[["SRR030702","108,499","25,631,107","236"]]]],[["SRS007441","Human pan T cell receptor repertoire a/b cDNA sequences covering CDR3 regions",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007442","Human pan T cell receptor repertoire a/b cDNA sequences covering CDR3 regions sample 2",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007443","Human pan T cell receptor a/b repertoire sample 3",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007444","human regular T cell receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007445","human helper T cell 1 (Th1) receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007446","human helper T cell 2 (Th2) receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007447","human Cytotoxic T cell (Tc) receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007448","human naive T cell (Tn) receptor a/b receptor",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007449","human activated T cell (Ta) receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007450","human memory T cell (Tm) receptor a/b repertoire",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA010852",[["20064465","Genome-wide analysis of PTB-RNA interactions reveals a strategy used by the general splicing repressor to modulate exon inclusion or skipping.","Mol Cell","2009-Dec-25","SRA010852","Recent transcriptome analysis indicates that > 90% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, underscoring the contribution of differential RNA processing to diverse proteomes in higher eukaryotic cells.

Given a user-defined cutoff for the false discovery rate, TagDust identifies all reads explainable by combinations and partial matches to known sequences used during library preparation. We demonstrate the quality of our method on sequencing runs performed on Illumina's Genome Analyzer platform.Executables and documentation are available from http://genome.gsc.riken.jp/osc/english/software/.timolassmann@gmail.com.","Lassmann T, Hayashizaki Y, Daub CO."]],["SRP000228","The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched a public research consortium named ENCODE, the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements, in September 2003, to carry out a project to identify all functional elements in the human genome sequence.

We used a total of 251,933,381 short-read sequence tags generated from various types of transcriptome analyses in order to characterize 6039 iTSCs, which have significant expression levels. We analyzed and found that 23% of these iTSCs were located in the proximal regions of the RefSeq genes. These RefSeq-linked iTSCs showed similar expression patterns with the neighboring RefSeq genes, had widely fluctuating transcription start sites and lacked ordered nucleosome positioning. These iTSCs seemed not to form independent transcriptional units, simply representing the by-products of the neighboring RefSeq genes, in spite of their significant expression levels. Similar features were also observed for the TSCs located in the antisense regions of the RefSeq genes.

We generated more than 100 million 36-base TSS-tag sequences and revealed comprehensive features of hypoxia responsive alterations in the transcriptional landscape of the human genome. The features include presence of inducible 'hot regions' in 54 genomic regions, 220 novel hypoxia inducible promoters that may drive non-protein-coding transcripts, 191 hypoxia responsive alternative promoters and detailed views of 120 novel as well as known hypoxia responsive genes. We further analyzed hypoxic response of different cells using additional 60 million TSS-tags and found that the degree of the gene-expression changes were different among cell lines, possibly reflecting cellular robustness against hypoxia.

(ddbj). Despite being rich data sources, they have not been used much due to the difficulty in locating and analyzing datasets of interest.Geoseq http://geoseq.mssm.edu provides a new method of analyzing short reads from deep sequencing experiments. Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. It is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. The analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs. The ease of using Geoseq for these analyses suggests its utility and uniqueness as an analysis tool.","Gurtowski J, Cancio A, Shah H, Levovitz C, George A, Homann R, Sachidanandam R."],["19169241","Post-transcriptional processing generates a diversity of 5'-modified long and short RNAs.","Nature","2009-Feb-19","SRA008169","The transcriptomes of eukaryotic cells are incredibly complex. Individual non-coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein-coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure. Deep sequencing of small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE (cap-analysis of gene expression) tags, which mark the 5' ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter-associated small RNAs, appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and non-coding genes, sometimes crossing exon-exon junctions. Here we show that processing of mature mRNAs through an as yet unknown mechanism may generate complex populations of both long and short RNAs whose apparently capped 5' ends coincide. Supplying synthetic promoter-associated small RNAs corresponding to the c-MYC transcriptional start site reduced MYC messenger RNA abundance. The studies presented here expand the catalogue of cellular small RNAs and demonstrate a biological impact for at least one class of non-canonical small RNAs.","Affymetrix ENCODE Transcriptome Project; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ENCODE Transcriptome Project."]],["SRP000599","no study abstract","We report an applicaton of small RNA sequencing using high throughput next generation sequencing to identify the small RNA content of cell lines.

More than 20 million 25-base 5'-end tags were obtained from untreated and 5Aza-treated cells and matched to sequences within the human genome. Seventy three percent of the mapped unique tags were associated with RefSeq cDNA sequences, corresponding to approximately 14,000 different protein-coding genes in this single cell type. The level of expression of these genes ranged from 0.02 to 4,704 transcripts per cell. The sensitivity of a single sequence run of the SOLiD platform was 100-1,000 fold greater than that observed from 5'end SAGE data generated from the analysis of 70,000 tags obtained by Sanger sequencing.

These predicted genomic loci are associated with chromatin patterns of modified histones that are predictive of regulated gene expression. 146 of the predicted microRNAs were enriched in Ago2-containing complexes along with 609 known microRNAs, demonstrating association with a functional RISC complex. This Ago2 IP-selected subset was consistently expressed in four independent hESC lines and exhibited complex patterns of regulation over development similar to previously-known microRNAs, including pluripotency-specific expression in both hESC and iPS cells. More than 30% of the Ago2 IP-enriched predicted microRNAs are new members of existing families since they share seed sequences with known microRNAs.Extending the classic definition of microRNAs, this large number of new microRNA genes, the majority of which are less conserved than their canonical counterparts, likely represent evolutionarily recent regulators of early differentiation. The enrichment in Ago2 containing complexes, the presence of chromatin marks indicative of regulated gene expression, and differential expression over development all support the identification of 146 new microRNAs active during early hESC differentiation.","Goff LA, Davila J, Swerdel MR, Moore JC, Cohen RI, Wu H, Sun YE, Hart RP."],["19478186","Genome-wide identification of human RNA editing sites by parallel DNA capturing and sequencing.","Science","2009-May-29","SRA008181","Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing leads to transcriptome diversity and is important for normal brain function.

Although DNA sequencing costs have fallen markedly, they remain far from what is necessary for rare and novel variants to be routinely identified at a genome-wide scale in large cohorts. We have therefore sought to develop second-generation methods for targeted sequencing of all protein-coding regions ('exomes'), to reduce costs while enriching for discovery of highly penetrant variants. Here we report on the targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing of the exomes of 12 humans. These include eight HapMap individuals representing three populations, and four unrelated individuals with a rare dominantly inherited disorder, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS). We demonstrate the sensitive and specific identification of rare and common variants in over 300 megabases of coding sequence. Using FSS as a proof-of-concept, we show that candidate genes for Mendelian disorders can be identified by exome sequencing of a small number of unrelated, affected individuals. This strategy may be extendable to diseases with more complex genetics through larger sample sizes and appropriate weighting of non-synonymous variants by predicted functional impact.","Ng SB, Turner EH, Robertson PD, Flygare SD, Bigham AW, Lee C, Shaffer T, Wong M, Bhattacharjee A, Eichler EE, Bamshad M, Nickerson DA, Shendure J."]],["SRP000910","no study abstract","The primary goal of this study is to comprehensively characterize sequence variation occuring in the coding portion of individual human genomes."],[["SRX005923","\n\tIllumina sequencing of H. sapiens DNA random fragment library enriched for exome sequences by solid-phase hybrid capture.

This expended repertoire of editing substrates will provide additional targets for understanding the role that RNA editing plays in normal brain function.","no study description"],[["SRX003281","no description for experiment design","Padlock capture, then PCR","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002190",[["SRR014491","5,145,193","210,952,913","41"]]],["SRX003283","no description for experiment design","padlock capture, then PCR","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002191",[["SRR014492","7,459,748","268,550,928","36"]]],["SRX003284","no description for experiment design","padlock capture, then PCR","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002192",[["SRR014493","5,538,459","227,076,819","41"]]],["SRX003285","no description for experiment design","padlock capture, then PCR","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002193",[["SRR014494","6,950,660","250,223,760","36"]]],["SRX003286","no description for experiment design","padlock capture, then PCR","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002194",[["SRR014495","7,114,728","256,130,208","36"]]],["SRX003287","no description for experiment design","padlock capture, then PCR","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002195",[["SRR014496","5,096,832","208,970,112","41"]]],["SRX003289","no description for experiment design","padlock capture, then PCR","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002196",[["SRR014497","5,420,151","222,226,191","41"]]],["SRX003290","no description for experiment design","padlock capture, then PCR","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002197",[["SRR014498","6,516,258","234,585,288","36"]]],["SRX003291","no description for experiment design","padlock capture, then PCR","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002198",[["SRR014499","6,354,025","228,744,900","36"]]],["SRX003292","no description for experiment design","padlock capture, then PCR","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002199",[["SRR014500","2,251,755","81,063,180","36"]]]],[["SRS002190","Targeted resequencing of >36,000 predicted putative RNA editing sites in cerebellum genomic DNA of donor N6.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is commonly used for CNV detection, but the microarray platform has a number of inherent limitations.Here, we describe a method to detect copy number variation using shotgun sequencing, CNV-seq. The method is based on a robust statistical model that describes the complete analysis procedure and allows the computation of essential confidence values for detection of CNV. Our results show that the number of reads, not the length of the reads is the key factor determining the resolution of detection. This favors the next-generation sequencing methods that rapidly produce large amount of short reads.Simulation of various sequencing methods with coverage between 0.1x to 8x show overall specificity between 91.7 - 99.9%, and sensitivity between 72.2 - 96.5%.

However, mapping chromosome breakpoints using traditional methods, such as in situ hybridization with fluorescent dye-labeled bacterial artificial chromosome clones (BAC-FISH), is rather laborious and time-consuming. In addition, the resolution of BAC-FISH is often insufficient to unequivocally identify the disrupted gene. To overcome these limitations, we have performed shotgun sequencing of flow-sorted derivative chromosomes using \"next-generation\" (Illumina/Solexa) multiplex sequencing-by-synthesis technology. As shown here for three different disease-associated BCRs, the coverage attained by this platform is sufficient to bridge the breakpoints by PCR amplification, and this procedure allows the determination of their exact nucleotide positions within a few weeks.

The aim of this platform is to facilitate the study of this Asian genome and to enable improved organization and presentation large-scale personal genome data. Powered by GBrowse, we illustrate here the genome sequences, SNPs, and sequencing reads in the MapView. The relationships between phenotype and genotype can be searched by location, dbSNP ID, HGMD ID, gene symbol and disease name. A BLAST web service is also provided for the purpose of aligning query sequence against YH genome consensus. The YH database is currently one of the three personal genome database, organizing the original data and analysis results in a user-friendly interface, which is an endeavor to achieve fundamental goals for establishing personal medicine.

The genome was sequenced to 36-fold average coverage using massively parallel sequencing technology. We aligned the short reads onto the NCBI human reference genome to 99.97% coverage, and guided by the reference genome, we used uniquely mapped reads to assemble a high-quality consensus sequence for 92% of the Asian individual's genome. We identified approximately 3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inside this region, of which 13.6% were not in the dbSNP database. Genotyping analysis showed that SNP identification had high accuracy and consistency, indicating the high sequence quality of this assembly. We also carried out heterozygote phasing and haplotype prediction against HapMap CHB and JPT haplotypes (Chinese and Japanese, respectively), sequence comparison with the two available individual genomes (J. D. Watson and J. C. Venter), and structural variation identification. These variations were considered for their potential biological impact.

Bioinformatics","2009","SRA000261","DNA copy number variation (CNV) has been recognized as an important source of genetic variation. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is commonly used for CNV detection, but the microarray platform has a number of inherent limitations.Here, we describe a method to detect copy number variation using shotgun sequencing, CNV-seq. The method is based on a robust statistical model that describes the complete analysis procedure and allows the computation of essential confidence values for detection of CNV.

This favors the next-generation sequencing methods that rapidly produce large amount of short reads.Simulation of various sequencing methods with coverage between 0.1x to 8x show overall specificity between 91.7 - 99.9%, and sensitivity between 72.2 - 96.5%.

However, mapping chromosome breakpoints using traditional methods, such as in situ hybridization with fluorescent dye-labeled bacterial artificial chromosome clones (BAC-FISH), is rather laborious and time-consuming. In addition, the resolution of BAC-FISH is often insufficient to unequivocally identify the disrupted gene. To overcome these limitations, we have performed shotgun sequencing of flow-sorted derivative chromosomes using \"next-generation\" (Illumina/Solexa) multiplex sequencing-by-synthesis technology. As shown here for three different disease-associated BCRs, the coverage attained by this platform is sufficient to bridge the breakpoints by PCR amplification, and this procedure allows the determination of their exact nucleotide positions within a few weeks. Its implementation will greatly facilitate large-scale breakpoint mapping and gene finding in patients with disease-associated balanced translocations.","Chen W, Kalscheuer V, Tzschach A, Menzel C, Ullmann R, Schulz MH, Erdogan F, Li N, Kijas Z, Arkesteijn G, Pajares IL, Goetz-Sothmann M, Heinrich U, Rost I, Dufke A, Grasshoff U, Glaeser B, Vingron M, Ropers HH."]],["SRP000102","\nWe have performed shotgun sequencing of flow-sorted derivative chromosomes using next generation (Solexa/Illumina) multiplex sequencing-by-synthesis technology.

Approximately 50-200ng of IP DNA was prepared for ligation of Solexa linkers by repairing the ends and adding a single adenine nucleotide overhang to allow for directional ligation.  A 1:100 dilution of the Adaptor Oligo Mix (Illumina) was used in the ligation step.  A subsequent PCR step with 18 amplification cycles added additional linker sequence to the fragments to prepare them for annealing to the Genome Analyzer flow-cell.  Amplified material was purified by Qiaquick MinElute (Qaigen) and a narrow range of fragment sizes was selected by separation on a 2% agarose gel and excision of a band between 150-300 bp, representing IP fragments between 50 and 200nt in length and ~100bp of primer sequence.  The DNA was purified from the agarose and diluted to 10 nM for loading on the flow cell.\nThe DNA library (2-4 pM) was applied to one lane of the flow-cell (eight samples per flow-cell) using a Cluster Station device (Illumina).  The concentration of library applied to the flow-cell was calibrated so that polonies generated in the bridge amplification step originate from single strands of DNA.  Multiple rounds of amplification reagents were flowed across the cell in the bridge amplification step to generate polonies of approximately 1,000 strands in 1µm diameter spots.  Double stranded polonies were visually checked for density and morphology by staining with a 1:5000 dilution of SYBR Green I (Invitrogen) and visualizing with a microscope under fluorescent illumination. Validated flow-cells were stored at 4 degrees C until sequencing.\nFlow-cells were removed from storage and subjected to linearization and annealing of sequencing primer on the Cluster Station.  Primed flow-cells were loaded into the Genome Analyzer 1G (Illumina).  After the first base was incorporated in the sequencing-by-synthesis reaction the process was paused for a key quality control checkpoint.  A small section of each lane was imaged and the average intensity value for all four bases was compared to minimum thresholds.  Flow-cells with low first base intensities were re-primed and if signal was not recovered the flow-cell was aborted.  Flow-cells with signal intensities meeting the minimum thresholds were resumed and sequenced.\nImages acquired from the Genome Analyzer were processed through the bundled image extraction pipeline (Illumina), which identified polony positions, performed base-calling and generated QC statistics.","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS113688",[["SRR064658","23,410,317","842,771,412","36"]]],["SRX026060","no description for experiment design","Protocols describing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) materials and methods can be downloaded from http://web.wi.mit.edu/young/hES_PRC and have previously been described in detail (Lee et al. 2006).\nHuman ES, iPS or fibroblast cells were grown to a final count of ~50 million cells to obtain starting material for six chromatin immunoprecipitations.

A subsequent PCR step with 18 amplification cycles added additional linker sequence to the fragments to prepare them for annealing to the Genome Analyzer flow-cell.  Amplified material was purified by Qiaquick MinElute (Qaigen) and a narrow range of fragment sizes was selected by separation on a 2% agarose gel and excision of a band between 150-300 bp, representing IP fragments between 50 and 200nt in length and ~100bp of primer sequence.  The DNA was purified from the agarose and diluted to 10 nM for loading on the flow cell.\nThe DNA library (2-4 pM) was applied to one lane of the flow-cell (eight samples per flow-cell) using a Cluster Station device (Illumina).  The concentration of library applied to the flow-cell was calibrated so that polonies generated in the bridge amplification step originate from single strands of DNA.  Multiple rounds of amplification reagents were flowed across the cell in the bridge amplification step to generate polonies of approximately 1,000 strands in 1µm diameter spots.  Double stranded polonies were visually checked for density and morphology by staining with a 1:5000 dilution of SYBR Green I (Invitrogen) and visualizing with a microscope under fluorescent illumination. Validated flow-cells were stored at 4 degrees C until sequencing.\nFlow-cells were removed from storage and subjected to linearization and annealing of sequencing primer on the Cluster Station.  Primed flow-cells were loaded into the Genome Analyzer 1G (Illumina).  After the first base was incorporated in the sequencing-by-synthesis reaction the process was paused for a key quality control checkpoint.  A small section of each lane was imaged and the average intensity value for all four bases was compared to minimum thresholds.  Flow-cells with low first base intensities were re-primed and if signal was not recovered the flow-cell was aborted.  Flow-cells with signal intensities meeting the minimum thresholds were resumed and sequenced.\nImages acquired from the Genome Analyzer were processed through the bundled image extraction pipeline (Illumina), which identified polony positions, performed base-calling and generated QC statistics.","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS113701",[["SRR064674","6,103,443","219,723,948","36"]]],["SRX026073","no description for experiment design","Protocols describing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) materials and methods can be downloaded from http://web.wi.mit.edu/young/hES_PRC and have previously been described in detail (Lee et al. 2006).\nHuman ES, iPS or fibroblast cells were grown to a final count of ~50 million cells to obtain starting material for six chromatin immunoprecipitations.

Approximately 50-200ng of IP DNA was prepared for ligation of Solexa linkers by repairing the ends and adding a single adenine nucleotide overhang to allow for directional ligation.  A 1:100 dilution of the Adaptor Oligo Mix (Illumina) was used in the ligation step.  A subsequent PCR step with 18 amplification cycles added additional linker sequence to the fragments to prepare them for annealing to the Genome Analyzer flow-cell.  Amplified material was purified by Qiaquick MinElute (Qaigen) and a narrow range of fragment sizes was selected by separation on a 2% agarose gel and excision of a band between 150-300 bp, representing IP fragments between 50 and 200nt in length and ~100bp of primer sequence.  The DNA was purified from the agarose and diluted to 10 nM for loading on the flow cell.\nThe DNA library (2-4 pM) was applied to one lane of the flow-cell (eight samples per flow-cell) using a Cluster Station device (Illumina).  The concentration of library applied to the flow-cell was calibrated so that polonies generated in the bridge amplification step originate from single strands of DNA.  Multiple rounds of amplification reagents were flowed across the cell in the bridge amplification step to generate polonies of approximately 1,000 strands in 1µm diameter spots.  Double stranded polonies were visually checked for density and morphology by staining with a 1:5000 dilution of SYBR Green I (Invitrogen) and visualizing with a microscope under fluorescent illumination. Validated flow-cells were stored at 4 degrees C until sequencing.\nFlow-cells were removed from storage and subjected to linearization and annealing of sequencing primer on the Cluster Station.  Primed flow-cells were loaded into the Genome Analyzer 1G (Illumina).  After the first base was incorporated in the sequencing-by-synthesis reaction the process was paused for a key quality control checkpoint.

Our data confirm earlier microsatellite-based findings that these species are genetically differentiated, but our population genomics approach reveals that hybridization and genetic introgression have recently occurred between the two species. The directionality of introgression is primarily from C. posadasii to C. immitis, and we find more than 800 genes exhibiting strong evidence of introgression in one or more sequenced isolates. We performed PCR-based sequencing of one region exhibiting introgression in 40 C. immitis isolates to confirm and better define the extent of gene flow between the species. We find more coding sequence than expected by chance in the introgressed regions, suggesting that natural selection may play a role in the observed genetic exchange. We find notable heterogeneity in repetitive sequence composition among the sequenced genomes and present the first detailed genome-wide profile of a repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) process distinctly different from what has been observed in Neurospora.

Here we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to explore the genome-wide localization of these transcription factors in human prostate cancer cell lines as well as tissues.  Unexpectedly, transcriptional networks emanating from AR and ERG were found to be highly overlapping.  Furthermore, AR was found to regulate known 5’ fusion partners in prostate cancer including TMPRSS2, as well as negatively regulating its own expression.

Importantly, androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells in which ERG is overexpressed are able to proliferate and invade in the absence of androgen.  Thus, we dissected the intertwined genomic landscape of two master transcriptional regulators of prostate cancer and suggest a role for ERG in maintaining transcriptional networks necessary for androgen-independent prostate cancer growth.

therapeutic and chemopreventive agents. To understand how ERbeta regulates genes, we identified genes regulated by the unliganded and liganded forms of ERalpha and ERbeta in U2OS cells. Microarray data demonstrated that virtually no gene regulation occurred with unliganded ERalpha, whereas many genes were regulated by estradiol (E(2)). These results demonstrated that ERalpha requires a ligand to regulate a single class of genes. In contrast, ERbeta regulated three classes of genes. Class I genes were regulated primarily by unliganded ERbeta. Class II genes were regulated only with E(2), whereas class III genes were regulated by both unliganded ERbeta and E(2). There were 453 class I genes, 258 class II genes, and 83 class III genes. To explore the mechanism whereby ERbeta regulates different classes of genes, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing was performed to identify ERbeta binding sites and adjacent transcription factor motifs in regulated genes. AP1 binding sites were more enriched in class I genes, whereas ERE, NFkappaB1, and SP1 sites were more enriched in class II genes. ERbeta bound to all three classes of genes, demonstrating that ERbeta binding is not responsible for differential regulation of genes by unliganded and liganded ERbeta. The coactivator NCOA2 was differentially recruited to several target genes.

We examined genome-wide differences in transcription factor (TF) binding in several humans and a single chimpanzee by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. The binding sites of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and a key regulator of immune responses, nuclear factor kappaB (p65), were mapped in 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines, and 25 and 7.5% of the respective binding regions were found to differ between individuals. Binding differences were frequently associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants, and these differences were often correlated with differences in gene expression, suggesting functional consequences of binding variation. Furthermore, comparing PolII binding between humans and chimpanzee suggests extensive divergence in TF binding. Our results indicate that many differences in individuals and species occur at the level of TF binding, and they provide insight into the genetic events responsible for these differences.","Kasowski M, Grubert F, Heffelfinger C, Hariharan M, Asabere A, Waszak SM, Habegger L, Rozowsky J, Shi M, Urban AE, Hong MY, Karczewski KJ, Huber W, Weissman SM, Gerstein MB, Korbel JO, Snyder M."]],["SRP002129","no study abstract","Summary: We examined genome-wide variation in transcription factor binding in different individuals and a chimpanzee using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively-parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq).

The MeDIP-seq analysis generated non-biased DNA methylation maps by covering almost the entire genome with sufficient depth and resolution. The most prominent feature of the BCC lines compared to HMEC was a massively reduced methylation level particularly in CpG-poor regions. While hypomethylation did not appear to be associated with particular genomic features, hypermethylation preferentially occurred at CpG-rich gene-related regions independently of the distance from transcription start sites. We also investigated methylome alterations during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MCF7 cells. EMT induction was associated with specific alterations to the methylation patterns of gene-related CpG-rich regions, although overall methylation levels were not significantly altered. Moreover, approximately 40% of the epithelial cell-specific methylation patterns in gene-related regions were altered to those typical of mesenchymal cells, suggesting a cell-type specific regulation of DNA methylation.This study provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of the methylome of human mammary cell lines and has produced novel insights into the mechanisms of methylome alteration during tumorigenesis and the interdependence between DNA methylome alterations and morphological changes.","Ruike Y, Imanaka Y, Sato F, Shimizu K, Tsujimoto G."]],["DRP000030","Cancer cells undergo massive alterations to their DNA methylation patterns that result in aberrant gene expression and malignant phenotypes.

The SUMOylation sites of IGF-1R were identified as three evolutionarily conserved lysine residues-Lys(1025), Lys(1100), and Lys(1120)-in the beta subunit of the receptor. Mutation of these SUMO-1 sites abolished the ability of IGF-1R to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription but did not alter its kinase-dependent signaling.

Transcriptional responses to this hormonal signal are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We determined GR binding throughout the human genome by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation DNA sequencing, and measured related changes in gene expression with mRNA sequencing in response to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX). We identified 4392 genomic positions occupied by the GR and 234 genes with significant changes in expression in response to DEX. This genomic census revealed striking differences between gene activation and repression by the GR. While genes activated with DEX treatment have GR bound within a median distance of 11 kb from the transcriptional start site (TSS), the nearest GR binding for genes repressed with DEX treatment is a median of 146 kb from the TSS, suggesting that DEX-mediated repression occurs independently of promoter-proximal GR binding. In addition to the dramatic differences in proximity of GR binding, we found differences in the kinetics of gene expression response for induced and repressed genes, with repression occurring substantially after induction. We also found that the GR can respond to different levels of corticosteroids in a gene-specific manner. For example, low doses of DEX selectively induced PER1, a transcription factor involved in regulating circadian rhythms. Overall, the genome-wide determination and analysis of GR:DNA binding and transcriptional response to hormone reveals new insights into the complexities of gene regulatory activities managed by GR.","Reddy TE, Pauli F, Sprouse RO, Neff NF, Newberry KM, Garabedian MJ, Myers RM."]],["SRP000762","Cortisol is a glucocorticoid steroid hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to acute stress and as a messenger in circadian rhythms.  Transcriptional responses to this hormonal signal are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).  Here, using massively parallel DNA sequencing, we determine GR binding across the human genome (using ChIP-seq) and measure related changes in gene expression (using mRNA-seq) in response to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX).  We identify 4,392 genomic positions occupied by the GR and 234 genes with significant changes in expression in response to DEX.  This genomic census reveals striking differences between activating and repressing activity of the GR.  First, genes activated by DEX have GR occupancy within a median distance of 10 kb from the transcriptional start site (TSS) while, for the genes repressed by DEX, the nearest GR binding site is a median of 150 kb from the TSS.  Furthermore, a reduction of GR levels by siRNA significantly and substantially reduces activation of GR target genes, but repression of transcription by DEX was largely unaffected.  These results suggest that DEX-mediated repression occurs independently of promoter proximal GR binding and is less sensitive to a reduction in the level of GR.  We also find that the GR can distinguish between different levels of corticosteroids in a gene-specific manner by, for example, selectively inducing PER1, a major transcription factor in circadian rhythms, at low doses of DEX.  Overall, our work both provides a genome-wide analysis of GR:DNA binding and transcriptional response and also reveals substantial new insights into the gene regulatory activities managed by GR.","ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis of dexamethasone response in A549 cells."],[["SRX004747","Illumina sequencing of RNA Pol2 ChIP in A549 Cells after 1h, 100nM Dexamethasone Treatment (Replicate 1)","A549 cells were treated for 1h with either 100nM Dexamethasone, or an equal volume of ethanol as a vehicle control, as indicated.

We find that sonication of cross-linked chromatin, when combined with a size-selection step and massively parallel short-read sequencing, can be used as a method (Sono-Seq) to map locations of high chromatin accessibility in promoter regions. Sono-Seq sites frequently correspond to actively transcribed promoter regions, as evidenced by their co-association with RNA Polymerase II ChIP regions, transcription start sites, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks, and CpG islands; signals over other sites, such as those bound by the CTCF insulator, are also observed. The pattern of breakage by Sono-Seq overlaps with, but is distinct from, that observed for FAIRE and DNase I hypersensitive sites. Our results demonstrate that Sono-Seq can be a useful and simple method by which to map many local alterations in chromatin structure.

In the first method, we designed approximately 10,000 bisulfite padlock probes to profile approximately 7,000 CpG locations distributed over the ENCODE pilot project regions and applied them to human B-lymphocytes, fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells. This unbiased choice of targets takes advantage of existing expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation data and enabled us to observe a pattern of low promoter methylation and high gene-body methylation in highly expressed genes. The second method, methyl-sensitive cut counting, generated nontargeted genome-scale data for approximately 1.4 million HpaII sites in the DNA of B-lymphocytes and confirmed that gene-body methylation in highly expressed genes is a consistent phenomenon throughout the human genome.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that association of Oct4 and Oct1 with a distinct group of in vivo targets is inducible by stress, and that Oct1 is essential for a normal post-stress transcriptional response.

The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies make it possible to extend the scope of structural variation studies to a point previously unimaginable as exemplified by the 1000 Genomes Project. Although various computational methods have been described for the detection of SVs, no such algorithm is yet fully capable of discovering transposon insertions, a very important class of SVs to the study of human evolution and disease. In this article, we provide a complete and novel formulation to discover both loci and classes of transposons inserted into genomes sequenced with high-throughput sequencing technologies. In addition, we also present 'conflict resolution' improvements to our earlier combinatorial SV detection algorithm (VariationHunter) by taking the diploid nature of the human genome into consideration. We test our algorithms with simulated data from the Venter genome (HuRef) and are able to discover >85% of transposon insertion events with precision of >90%. We also demonstrate that our conflict resolution algorithm (denoted as VariationHunter-CR) outperforms current state of the art (such as original VariationHunter, BreakDancer and MoDIL) algorithms when tested on the genome of the Yoruba African individual (NA18507).

Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence.

sequence of an ancient human. Obtained from approximately 4,000-year-old permafrost-preserved hair, the genome represents a male individual from the first known culture to settle in Greenland. Sequenced to an average depth of 20x, we recover 79% of the diploid genome, an amount close to the practical limit of current sequencing technologies. We identify 353,151 high-confidence single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 6.8% have not been reported previously. We estimate raw read contamination to be no higher than 0.8%. We use functional SNP assessment to assign possible phenotypic characteristics of the individual that belonged to a culture whose location has yielded only trace human remains. We compare the high-confidence SNPs to those of contemporary populations to find the populations most closely related to the individual. This provides evidence for a migration from Siberia into the New World some 5,500 years ago, independent of that giving rise to the modern Native Americans and Inuit.","Rasmussen M, Li Y, Lindgreen S, Pedersen JS, Albrechtsen A, Moltke I, Metspalu M, Metspalu E, Kivisild T, Gupta R, Bertalan M, Nielsen K, Gilbert MT, Wang Y, Raghavan M, Campos PF, Kamp HM, Wilson AS, Gledhill A, Tridico S, Bunce M, Lorenzen ED, Binladen J, Guo X, Zhao J, Zhang X, Zhang H, Li Z, Chen M, Orlando L, Kristiansen K, Bak M, Tommerup N, Bendixen C, Pierre TL, Grønnow B, Meldgaard M, Andreasen C, Fedorova SA, Osipova LP, Higham TF, Ramsey CB, Hansen TV, Nielsen FC, Crawford MH, Brunak S, Sicheritz-Pontén T, Villems R, Nielsen R, Krogh A, Wang J, Willerslev E."]],["SRP001453","We report the first ancient human genome.

Here, we describe the broad genome sequencing of U87MG, a commonly used and thus well-studied glioblastoma cell line. One of the major features of the U87MG genome is the large number of chromosomal abnormalities, which can be typical of cancer cell lines and primary cancers. The systematic, thorough and accurate mutational analysis of the U87MG genome comprehensively identifies different classes of genetic mutations including single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and translocations. We found 2,384,470 SNVs, 191,743 small indels and 1,314 large structural variations. Known gene models were used to predict the effect of these mutations on protein-coding sequence. Mutational analysis revealed 512 genes homozygously mutated, including 154 by SNVs, 178 by small indels, 145 by large microdeletions and up to 35 by interchromosomal translocations. The major mutational mechanisms in this brain cancer cell line are small indels and large structural variations. The genomic landscape of U87MG is revealed to be much more complex than previously thought based on lower resolution techniques. This mutational analysis serves as a resource for past and future studies on U87MG, informing them with a thorough description of its mutational state."],[["SRX015657","The goal of this sequencing experiment was to as completely as possible sequence the whole genome of the U87MG glioblastoma cell line. This required the generation of a single random genomic paired-end library with 10ug of starting DNA. Utilizing the ABI long mate-pair protocol, we produced 1,014,984,286 raw 50bp mate-paired reads (101.5Gb). In some cases the bead was recognized by the imaging software for only one read, thereby producing an additional 120,691,623 single end reads (6.0Gb). In aggregate, we generated a total of 107.5Gb of raw data.","Long-Mate-Paired Library Construction: The U87MG genomic DNA 2x 50bp long mate-paired library construction was carried out using the reagents and protocol provided by Applied Biosystems (SOLiD 3 System Library Preparation Guide).  A similar protocol was reported previously [17]. Briefly, 45ug of genomic DNA was fragmented by HydroShear (Digilab Genomic Solutions Inc) to 1.0-2.5kb. The fragmented DNA was repaired by the End-It DNA End-Repair Kit (Epicentre). Subsequently, the LMP CAP adaptor was ligated to the ends. DNA Fragments between 1.2-1.7kb were selected by 1.0 % agarose gel to avoid concatamers and circularized with a biotinylated internal adaptor. Non-circularized DNA fragments were eliminated by Plasmid-Safe ATP-Dependent DNase (Epicentre) and 3ug of circularized DNA was recovered after purification. Original DNA nicks at the LMP CAP oligo/genomic insert border were translated into the target genomic DNA about 100bp by nick translation using E. coli DNA polymerase I. Fragments containing the target genomic DNA and adaptors were cleaved from the circularized DNA by single-strand specific S1 nuclease. P1 and P2 adaptors were ligated to the fragments and the ligated mixture was used to create two separate libraries with 10 cycles of PCR amplification. Finally, 250-300bp fragments were selected to generate mate paired sequencing libraries with average target genomic DNA on each end around 90bp by excision from PAGE gel and use as emulsion PCR template. Templated Beads Preparation: The templated beads preparation was performed using the reagents and protocol from the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems SOLiD 3 Templated Beads Preparation Guide).

Here, we study the role of replication in the neutral substitution pattern. We obtained a high-resolution replication timing profile of the whole human genome by massively parallel sequencing of nascent BrdU-labeled replicating DNA. These data were compared to the neutral substitution rates along the human genome, obtained by aligning human and chimpanzee genomes using macaque and orangutan as outgroups. All substitution rates increase monotonously with replication timing even after controlling for local or regional nucleotide composition, crossover rate, distance to telomeres, and chromatin compaction. The increase in non-CpG substitution rates might result from several mechanisms including the increase in mutation-prone activities or the decrease in efficiency of DNA repair during the S phase. In contrast, the rate of C --> T transitions in CpG dinucleotides increases in later-replicating regions due to increasing DNA methylation level that reflects a negative correlation between timing and gene expression. Similar results are observed in the mouse, which indicates that replication timing is a main factor affecting nucleotide substitution dynamics at non-CpG sites and constitutes a major neutral process driving mammalian genome evolution.","Chen CL, Rappailles A, Duquenne L, Huvet M, Guilbaud G, Farinelli L, Audit B, d'Aubenton-Carafa Y, Arneodo A, Hyrien O, Thermes C."]],["SRP001727","We obtained a high-resolution replication timing profile of the whole human genome by massive sequencing of nascent BrdU-labeled replicating DNA.

The enrichment of sequence reads along the genome was computed in each S phase compartment. Replication timing of a defined genome region was estimated from the fraction of the S phase (S50) at which 50% of the sequence reads that map in this region were obtained. Significant correlations were observed between these S50 values and the timing data from HeLa cells measured in ENCODE regions, or the low-resolution timing data from human lymphocytes. A defined window can be significantly enriched in 1, 2, 3 or 4 Si periods. A window is temporally specific (synchronously replicated) (i) if the enrichment in any Si period was at least twice the enrichment of each of the three other periods or, (ii) if the sum of any two adjacent periods was at least three times the enrichment of each of the two other periods. Windows that do not satisfy these criteria are designated as temporally non-specific or asynchronously replicated. We observed that a small amount of regions were asynchronously replicated (7.41%).

disease. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies make it possible to extend the scope of structural variation studies to a point previously unimaginable as exemplified by the 1000 Genomes Project. Although various computational methods have been described for the detection of SVs, no such algorithm is yet fully capable of discovering transposon insertions, a very important class of SVs to the study of human evolution and disease. In this article, we provide a complete and novel formulation to discover both loci and classes of transposons inserted into genomes sequenced with high-throughput sequencing technologies. In addition, we also present 'conflict resolution' improvements to our earlier combinatorial SV detection algorithm (VariationHunter) by taking the diploid nature of the human genome into consideration. We test our algorithms with simulated data from the Venter genome (HuRef) and are able to discover >85% of transposon insertion events with precision of >90%. We also demonstrate that our conflict resolution algorithm (denoted as VariationHunter-CR) outperforms current state of the art (such as original VariationHunter, BreakDancer and MoDIL) algorithms when tested on the genome of the Yoruba African individual (NA18507).

Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown.

Repli-Seq is based on a previously described STS replication assay (PMID: 9114034, PMID: 8324827) and has been modiﬁed for sequence analysis of newly replicated DNA. The procedure is similar for attached and unattached cell types. Brieﬂy, 5–20 million cultured cells in exponential growth phase were incubated with 50 μM BrdU in growth medium so as to label the newly replicating DNA in vivo (6). Cells were harvested 1–1.5 h later either by direct centrifugation for unattached cells or by trypsinization and centrifugation for attached cells. After washing the cells, their DNA was stained with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) in nonionic detergent (Nonidet P-40), and this material was syringed several times and ﬁltered in preparation for ﬂow cytometry. The staining solution also contains 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for freezing extra cells at −70°C for later ﬂow sorting, if needed.    Flow cytometry was performed either on an EPICS Elite (1) or an Inﬂux (Cytopeia/BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) ﬂow cytometer and sorting was performed according to the contiguous DAPI ﬂuorescence channels (G1a, G1b, S1, S2, S3, S4, and G2/M; the G1a fractions generally had high backgrounds and were not processed for sequencing). Because different lineages have different cell-cycle distributions and cytometry patterns, the standard method for DAPI channel deﬁnitions is to divide the G1 peak-to-G2/M peak value by 6 for the G1b- and S-phase in crements in DAPI content (starting from the G1 peak); G1a is one half of this increment and G2 is twice this increment.    The number of cells sorted per channel varied among the different cell lines but was typically 50,000. The cells were sorted two channels at a time into tubes containing cell lysis buffer over a period of about 90 min for all channels to be sorted. DNA was then puriﬁed from the lysates by phenol extraction and the BrdU-DNA was isolated following heat denaturation by immunoprecipitation using an anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Following puriﬁcation from the immunoprecipitate, the newly replicated single-stranded BrdU-DNA was then made double-stranded by random-primed extension with a random hexamer labeling kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The puriﬁed material was quantiﬁed with PicoGreen staining (Invitrogen) using a NanoDrop 3300 ﬂuorospectrometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA).","Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed from the random-primed BrdU-DNA material according to standard procedures. Illumina’s genomic prep kit protocol was used with minor modifications (Illumina, Hayward, CA): 10–50 ng of purified random-primed products were subjected to end repair by combining fractionated DNA, 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer (containing 0.1 mM ATP), 0.4 mM dNTP mix, 15 units T4 DNA polymerase, 5 units DNA polymerase (Klenow, large fragment), and 50 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, Ipswich, MA). The reaction mixture was incubated at 20°C for 30 minutes and purified using a MinElute micro spin column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Following repair, non-templated adenines were added to the 3' ends of purified fragments with 1 mM dATP and 5 units Klenow fragment (3'-5' exo-minus) (NEB) and incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes.    After column purification, adapters (Illumina) were ligated to the ends of DNA fragments in a 50 µl reaction by combining 17.5 μl ‘A-tailed’ fragments, 25 μl 2X Quick DNA ligase buffer (NEB), 2.5 μl adapter oligo mix (Illumina), and 5 μl Quick DNA ligase (NEB) and incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature. The adapter-ligated material was then purified with MinElute columns (Qiagen) and enriched by a limited amplification: 50 μl reactions consisting of 5 μl adapter-ligated DNA (equivalent to about one tenth of the ligated material), 25 μl 2X Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB), 0.5 μl each of primer 1.1 and 2.1 (Illumina), and 19 μl nuclease-free water were assembled and cycled with the following thermal profile: 98°C for 30 min, followed by 16 cycles of 98°C for 10 min, 65°C for 30 min, and 72°C for 30 min with a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes.    Amplified libraries were purified with a MinElute micro spin column (Qiagen) and size-fractionated using agarose electrophoresis. Fragments in the 250–500 bp range were purified from the gel using the Qiagen gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and quantified with PicoGreen staining.

Flow cytometry was performed either on an EPICS Elite (1) or an In?ux (Cytopeia/BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) ?ow cytometer and sorting was performed according to the contiguous DAPI ?uorescence channels (G1a, G1b, S1, S2, S3, S4, and G2/M; the G1a fractions generally had high backgrounds and were not processed for sequencing). Because different lineages have different cell-cycle distributions and cytometry patterns, the standard method for DAPI channel de?nitions is to divide the G1 peak-to-G2/M peak value by 6 for the G1b- and S-phase in crements in DAPI content (starting from the G1 peak); G1a is one half of this increment and G2 is twice this increment.    The number of cells sorted per channel varied among the different cell lines but was typically 50,000. The cells were sorted two channels at a time into tubes containing cell lysis buffer over a period of about 90 min for all channels to be sorted. DNA was then puri?ed from the lysates by phenol extraction and the BrdU-DNA was isolated following heat denaturation by immunoprecipitation using an anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Following puri?cation from the immunoprecipitate, the newly replicated single-stranded BrdU-DNA was then made double-stranded by random-primed extension with a random hexamer labeling kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The puri?ed material was quanti?ed with PicoGreen staining (Invitrogen) using a NanoDrop 3300 ?uorospectrometer (Thermo Scienti?c, Waltham, MA).","Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed from the random-primed BrdU-DNA material according to standard procedures. Illumina’s genomic prep kit protocol was used with minor modifications (Illumina, Hayward, CA): 10–50 ng of purified random-primed products were subjected to end repair by combining fractionated DNA, 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer (containing 0.1 mM ATP), 0.4 mM dNTP mix, 15 units T4 DNA polymerase, 5 units DNA polymerase (Klenow, large fragment), and 50 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, Ipswich, MA). The reaction mixture was incubated at 20°C for 30 minutes and purified using a MinElute micro spin column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Following repair, non-templated adenines were added to the 3' ends of purified fragments with 1 mM dATP and 5 units Klenow fragment (3'-5' exo-minus) (NEB) and incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes.    After column purification, adapters (Illumina) were ligated to the ends of DNA fragments in a 50 µl reaction by combining 17.5 µl ‘A-tailed’ fragments, 25 µl 2X Quick DNA ligase buffer (NEB), 2.5 µl adapter oligo mix (Illumina), and 5 µl Quick DNA ligase (NEB) and incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature. The adapter-ligated material was then purified with MinElute columns (Qiagen) and enriched by a limited amplification: 50 µl reactions consisting of 5 µl adapter-ligated DNA (equivalent to about one tenth of the ligated material), 25 µl 2X Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB), 0.5 µl each of primer 1.1 and 2.1 (Illumina), and 19 µl nuclease-free water were assembled and cycled with the following thermal profile: 98°C for 30 min, followed by 16 cycles of 98°C for 10 min, 65°C for 30 min, and 72°C for 30 min with a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes.

The number of cells sorted per channel varied among the different cell lines but was typically 50,000. The cells were sorted two channels at a time into tubes containing cell lysis buffer over a period of about 90 min for all channels to be sorted. DNA was then puri?ed from the lysates by phenol extraction and the BrdU-DNA was isolated following heat denaturation by immunoprecipitation using an anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Following puri?cation from the immunoprecipitate, the newly replicated single-stranded BrdU-DNA was then made double-stranded by random-primed extension with a random hexamer labeling kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Illumina’s genomic prep kit protocol was used with minor modifications (Illumina, Hayward, CA): 10–50 ng of purified random-primed products were subjected to end repair by combining fractionated DNA, 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer (containing 0.1 mM ATP), 0.4 mM dNTP mix, 15 units T4 DNA polymerase, 5 units DNA polymerase (Klenow, large fragment), and 50 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, Ipswich, MA). The reaction mixture was incubated at 20°C for 30 minutes and purified using a MinElute micro spin column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Following repair, non-templated adenines were added to the 3' ends of purified fragments with 1 mM dATP and 5 units Klenow fragment (3'-5' exo-minus) (NEB) and incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes.

The adapter-ligated material was then purified with MinElute columns (Qiagen) and enriched by a limited amplification: 50 µl reactions consisting of 5 µl adapter-ligated DNA (equivalent to about one tenth of the ligated material), 25 µl 2X Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB), 0.5 µl each of primer 1.1 and 2.1 (Illumina), and 19 µl nuclease-free water were assembled and cycled with the following thermal profile: 98°C for 30 min, followed by 16 cycles of 98°C for 10 min, 65°C for 30 min, and 72°C for 30 min with a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes.

The cells were sorted two channels at a time into tubes containing cell lysis buffer over a period of about 90 min for all channels to be sorted. DNA was then puri?ed from the lysates by phenol extraction and the BrdU-DNA was isolated following heat denaturation by immunoprecipitation using an anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Following puri?cation from the immunoprecipitate, the newly replicated single-stranded BrdU-DNA was then made double-stranded by random-primed extension with a random hexamer labeling kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Illumina’s genomic prep kit protocol was used with minor modifications (Illumina, Hayward, CA): 10–50 ng of purified random-primed products were subjected to end repair by combining fractionated DNA, 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer (containing 0.1 mM ATP), 0.4 mM dNTP mix, 15 units T4 DNA polymerase, 5 units DNA polymerase (Klenow, large fragment), and 50 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, Ipswich, MA). The reaction mixture was incubated at 20°C for 30 minutes and purified using a MinElute micro spin column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Following repair, non-templated adenines were added to the 3' ends of purified fragments with 1 mM dATP and 5 units Klenow fragment (3'-5' exo-minus) (NEB) and incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes.    After column purification, adapters (Illumina) were ligated to the ends of DNA fragments in a 50 µl reaction by combining 17.5 µl ‘A-tailed’ fragments, 25 µl 2X Quick DNA ligase buffer (NEB), 2.5 µl adapter oligo mix (Illumina), and 5 µl Quick DNA ligase (NEB) and incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature. The adapter-ligated material was then purified with MinElute columns (Qiagen) and enriched by a limited amplification: 50 µl reactions consisting of 5 µl adapter-ligated DNA (equivalent to about one tenth of the ligated material), 25 µl 2X Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB), 0.5 µl each of primer 1.1 and 2.1 (Illumina), and 19 µl nuclease-free water were assembled and cycled with the following thermal profile: 98°C for 30 min, followed by 16 cycles of 98°C for 10 min, 65°C for 30 min, and 72°C for 30 min with a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes.    Amplified libraries were purified with a MinElute micro spin column (Qiagen) and size-fractionated using agarose electrophoresis.

We collected several billion mate-paired reads yielding approximately 18x haploid coverage of aligned sequence and close to 300x clone coverage. Over 98% of the reference genome is covered with at least one uniquely placed read, and 99.65% is spanned by at least one uniquely placed mate-paired clone. We identify over 3.8 million SNPs, 19% of which are novel. Mate-paired data are used to physically resolve haplotype phases of nearly two-thirds of the genotypes obtained and produce phased segments of up to 215 kb. We detect 226,529 intra-read indels, 5590 indels between mate-paired reads, 91 inversions, and four gene fusions. We use a novel approach for detecting indels between mate-paired reads that are smaller than the standard deviation of the insert size of the library and discover deletions in common with those detected with our intra-read approach. Dozens of mutations previously described in OMIM and hundreds of nonsynonymous single-nucleotide and structural variants in genes previously implicated in disease are identified in this individual. There is more genetic variation in the human genome still to be uncovered, and we provide guidance for future surveys in populations and cancer biopsies.","McKernan KJ, Peckham HE, Costa GL, McLaughlin SF, Fu Y, Tsung EF, Clouser CR, Duncan C, Ichikawa JK, Lee CC, Zhang Z, Ranade SS, Dimalanta ET, Hyland FC, Sokolsky TD, Zhang L, Sheridan A, Fu H, Hendrickson CL, Li B, Kotler L, Stuart JR, Malek JA, Manning JM, Antipova AA, Perez DS, Moore MP, Hayashibara KC, Lyons MR, Beaudoin RE, Coleman BE, Laptewicz MW, Sannicandro AE, Rhodes MD, Gottimukkala RK, Yang S, Bafna V, Bashir A, MacBride A, Alkan C, Kidd JM, Eichler EE, Reese MG, De La Vega FM, Blanchard AP."]],["SRP000726","High-throughput sequencing technologies have greatly increased the power of human genome variability studies.

These libraries were extensively sequenced using SOLiD (ABI's next generation sequencing platform). The deep sequence coverage obtained from these diverse libraries not only helps identify SNPs in this genome but also submicroscopic structural variations like insertions/deletions.

We show that a collection of approximately 14 million aligned sequence reads from human cell lines has comparable power to detect events as the current generation of DNA microarrays and has over twofold better precision for localizing breakpoints (typically, to within approximately 1 kilobase)","no study description"],[["SRX000672","200 bp libraries were created from material which was hybrid selected from a mixed DNA sample (H. sapiens HapMap NA 15510:P.falciparum 3D7) with plasmodium whole genome baits.","no description for library construction","Illumina Genome Analyzer II","Base Space","SRS166965","no sequence run information"],["SRX000673","Indexed sequencing on Illumina","no description for library construction","Illumina HiSeq 2000","Base Space","SRS024887","no sequence run information"],["SRX000675","Indexed sequencing on Illumina","no description for library construction","Illumina HiSeq 2000","no sequence space information","SRS024887","no sequence run information"],["SRX000677","Indexed sequencing on Illumina","no description for library construction","Illumina HiSeq 2000","Base Space","SRS024887","no sequence run information"],["SRX036691","Cancer Copy Number Alteration: NCI-H2347 and NCI-H2347BL","no description for library construction","Illumina Genome Analyzer II","Base Space","SRS000834",[["SRR002807","9,563,070","344,270,520","36"],["SRR002808","9,567,388","344,425,968","36"],["SRR002809","9,535,485","343,277,460","36"]]],["SRX036692","Cancer Copy Number Alteration: HCC1954 and HCC1954BL","no description for library construction","Illumina Genome Analyzer II","Base Space","SRS000832",[["SRR002796","3,931,604","141,537,744","36"],["SRR002797","5,036,456","181,312,416","36"],["SRR002798","4,821,607","173,577,852","36"],["SRR002799","4,808,497","173,105,892","36"]]],["SRX036693","Cancer Copy Number Alteration: HCC1143 and HCC1143BL","no description for library construction","Illumina Genome Analyzer II","Base Space","SRS000831",[["SRR002803","11,152,759","401,499,324","36"],["SRR002804","11,190,398","402,854,328","36"],["SRR002805","11,320,021","407,520,756","36"],["SRR002806","11,099,790","399,592,440","36"]]],["SRX036694","Cancer Copy Number Alteration: HCC1143 and HCC1143BL","no description for library construction","Illumina Genome Analyzer II","Base Space","SRS000833",[["SRR002800","11,171,642","402,179,112","36"],["SRR002801","11,513,464","414,484,704","36"],["SRR002802","11,608,441","417,903,876","36"]]],["SRX036695","Cancer Copy Number Alteration: HCC1954 and HCC1954BL","no description for library construction","Illumina Genome Analyzer II","Base Space","SRS000835",[["SRR002786","5,935,893","189,948,576","32"],["SRR002787","5,880,415","188,173,280","32"],["SRR002788","6,334,187","202,693,984","32"],["SRR002789","6,313,140","202,020,480","32"]]],["SRX036696","Cancer Copy Number Alteration: HCC1954 and HCC1954BL","no description for library construction","Illumina Genome Analyzer II","Base Space","SRS000835",[["SRR002793","4,610,681","165,984,516","36"],["SRR002794","5,884,117","211,828,212","36"],["SRR002795","5,846,641","210,479,076","36"]]],["SRX036697","Cancer Copy Number Alteration: HCC1954 and HCC1954BL","no description for library construction","Illumina Genome Analyzer II","Base Space","SRS000832",[["SRR002790","4,184,120","133,891,840","32"],["SRR002791","4,147,334","132,714,688","32"],["SRR002792","4,280,984","136,991,488","32"]]]],[["SRS000830","no sample description",[["cell line","BL2347"],["tissue source","Peripheral Blood"],["Sample ID","BL2347"]]],["SRS000831","no sample description",[["cell line","HCC1143 Breast Carcinoma"],["BI GSSR Sample Type","Genomic DNA"],["BI GSSR Sample LSID","BROAD:SEQUENCING_SAMPLE:11933.0"],["BI GSSR Sample ID","11933.0"]]],["SRS000832","no sample description",[["cell line","HCC1954 BL EVB-transformed lymphoblastoid"],["BI GSSR Sample Type","Genomic DNA"],["BI GSSR Sample LSID","BROAD:SEQUENCING_SAMPLE:11940.0"],["BI GSSR Sample ID","11940.0"]]],["SRS000833","no sample description",[["cell line","HCC1143 BL EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid"],["BI GSSR Sample Type","Genomic DNA"],["BI GSSR Sample LSID","BROAD:SEQUENCING_SAMPLE:11935.0"],["BI GSSR Sample ID","11935.0"]]],["SRS000834","no sample description",[["cell line","H2347"],["tissue source","Lung"],["BI GSSR Sample Type","Genomic DNA"],["BI GSSR Sample LSID","BROAD:SEQUENCING_SAMPLE:13398.0"],["BI GSSR Sample ID","13398.0"]]],["SRS000835","no sample description",[["cell line","HCC1954 Breast Carcinoma"],["BI GSSR Sample Type","Genomic DNA"],["BI GSSR Sample LSID","BROAD:SEQUENCING_SAMPLE:11937.0"],["BI GSSR Sample ID","11937.0"]]]]],["SRA000271",[["20529927","Next-generation VariationHunter: combinatorial algorithms for transposon insertion discovery.","Bioinformatics","2010-Jun-15","SRA000271","Recent years have witnessed an increase in research activity for the detection of structural variants (SVs) and their association to human disease. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies make it possible to extend the scope of structural variation studies to a point previously unimaginable as exemplified by the 1000 Genomes Project. Although various computational methods have been described for the detection of SVs, no such algorithm is yet fully capable of discovering transposon insertions, a very important class of SVs to the study of human evolution and disease. In this article, we provide a complete and novel formulation to discover both loci and classes of transposons inserted into genomes sequenced with high-throughput sequencing technologies. In addition, we also present 'conflict resolution' improvements to our earlier combinatorial SV detection algorithm (VariationHunter) by taking the diploid nature of the human genome into consideration. We test our algorithms with simulated data from the Venter genome (HuRef) and are able to discover >85% of transposon insertion events with precision of >90%. We also demonstrate that our conflict resolution algorithm (denoted as VariationHunter-CR) outperforms current state of the art (such as original VariationHunter, BreakDancer and MoDIL) algorithms when tested on the genome of the Yoruba African individual (NA18507). AVAILABILITY: The implementation of algorithm is available at http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/strvar.htm.

We identified approximately 5 Mb of novel sequences not present in the reference genome in each of these assemblies. Most novel sequences are individual or population specific, as revealed by their comparison to all available human DNA sequence and by PCR validation using the human genome diversity cell line panel. We found novel sequences present in patterns consistent with known human migration paths. Cross-species conservation analysis of predicted genes indicated that the novel sequences contain potentially functional coding regions. We estimate that a complete human pan-genome would contain approximately 19-40 Mb of novel sequence not present in the extant reference genome. The extensive amount of novel sequence contributing to the genetic variation of the pan-genome indicates the importance of using complete genome sequencing and de novo assembly.","Li R, Li Y, Zheng H, Luo R, Zhu H, Li Q, Qian W, Ren Y, Tian G, Li J, Zhou G, Zhu X, Wu H, Qin J, Jin X, Li D, Cao H, Hu X, Blanche H, Cann H, Zhang X, Li S, Bolund L, Kristiansen K, Yang H, Wang J, Wang J."],["18987734","Accurate whole human genome sequencing using reversible terminator chemistry.","Nature","2008-Nov-6","SRA000271","DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown.

In this article, we will introduce a new alignment approach (Slider) that reduces the alignment problem space by utilizing each read base's probabilities given in the prb files. RESULTS: Compared with other aligners, Slider has higher alignment accuracy and efficiency. In addition, given that Slider matches bases with probabilities other than the most probable, it significantly reduces the percentage of base mismatches. The result is that its SNP predictions are more accurate than other SNP prediction approaches used today that start from the most probable sequence, including those using base quality.","Malhis N, Butterfield YS, Ester M, Jones SJ."]],["SRP000239","We have generated paired-end sequence data covering the genome of an African male individual to a sequence depth of more than 40-fold using the Illumina Genome Analyzer.

The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies make it possible to extend the scope of structural variation studies to a point previously unimaginable as exemplified by the 1000 Genomes Project. Although various computational methods have been described for the detection of SVs, no such algorithm is yet fully capable of discovering transposon insertions, a very important class of SVs to the study of human evolution and disease. In this article, we provide a complete and novel formulation to discover both loci and classes of transposons inserted into genomes sequenced with high-throughput sequencing technologies. In addition, we also present 'conflict resolution' improvements to our earlier combinatorial SV detection algorithm (VariationHunter) by taking the diploid nature of the human genome into consideration. We test our algorithms with simulated data from the Venter genome (HuRef) and are able to discover >85% of transposon insertion events with precision of >90%. We also demonstrate that our conflict resolution algorithm (denoted as VariationHunter-CR) outperforms current state of the art (such as original VariationHunter, BreakDancer and MoDIL) algorithms when tested on the genome of the Yoruba African individual (NA18507). AVAILABILITY: The implementation of algorithm is available at http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/strvar.htm.

We identified approximately 5 Mb of novel sequences not present in the reference genome in each of these assemblies. Most novel sequences are individual or population specific, as revealed by their comparison to all available human DNA sequence and by PCR validation using the human genome diversity cell line panel. We found novel sequences present in patterns consistent with known human migration paths. Cross-species conservation analysis of predicted genes indicated that the novel sequences contain potentially functional coding regions. We estimate that a complete human pan-genome would contain approximately 19-40 Mb of novel sequence not present in the extant reference genome.

Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown.

In this article, we will introduce a new alignment approach (Slider) that reduces the alignment problem space by utilizing each read base's probabilities given in the prb files. RESULTS: Compared with other aligners, Slider has higher alignment accuracy and efficiency. In addition, given that Slider matches bases with probabilities other than the most probable, it significantly reduces the percentage of base mismatches. The result is that its SNP predictions are more accurate than other SNP prediction approaches used today that start from the most probable sequence, including those using base quality.","Malhis N, Butterfield YS, Ester M, Jones SJ."]],["SRP000239","We have generated paired-end sequence data covering the genome of an African male individual to a sequence depth of more than 40-fold using the Illumina Genome Analyzer.
