However, molecular resources for ectothermic reptiles are severely limited, hampering our ability to study the genetic basis for many evolutionarily important traits such as metabolic plasticity, extreme longevity, limblessness, venom, and freeze tolerance. Here we use massively parallel sequencing (454 GS-FLX Titanium) to generate a transcriptome of the western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) with two goals in mind. First, we develop a molecular resource for an ectothermic reptile; and second, we use these sex-specific transcriptomes to identify differences in the presence of expressed transcripts and potential genes of evolutionary interest.Using sex-specific pools of RNA (one pool for females, one pool for males) representing 7 tissue types and 35 diverse individuals, we produced 1.24 million sequence reads, which averaged 366 bp in length after cleaning. Assembly of the cleaned reads from both sexes with NEWBLER and MIRA resulted in 96,379 contigs containing 87% of the cleaned reads. Over 34% of these contigs and 13% of the singletons were annotated based on homology to previously identified proteins. From these homology assignments, additional clustering, and ORF predictions, we estimate that this transcriptome contains ~13,000 unique genes that were previously identified in other species and over 66,000 transcripts from unidentified protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we use a graph-clustering method to identify contigs linked by NEWBLER-split reads that represent divergent alleles, gene duplications, and alternatively spliced transcripts. Beyond gene identification, we identified 95,295 SNPs and 31,651 INDELs. From these sex-specific transcriptomes, we identified 190 genes that were only present in the mRNA sequenced from one of the sexes (84 female-specific, 106 male-specific), and many highly variable genes of evolutionary interest.This is the first large-scale, multi-organ transcriptome for an ectothermic reptile. This resource provides the most comprehensive set of EST sequences available for an individual ectothermic reptile species, increasing the number of snake ESTs 50-fold. We have identified genes that appear to be under evolutionary selection and those that are sex-specific. This resource will assist studies on gene expression and comparative genomics, and will facilitate the study of evolutionarily important traits at the molecular level.","Schwartz TS, Tae H, Yang Y, Mockaitis K, Van Hemert JL, Proulx SR, Choi JH, Bronikowski AM."]],["SRP001426","no study abstract","Transcriptome of two elevations, full age-range, of male and female garter snakes from Lassen County, California (Eagle Lake vicinity)"],[["SRX013124","no description for experiment design","Pooled mRNA, normalized, 454 GS-FLX Titanium chemistries","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS007366",[["SRR030394","60,821","30,143,771","495"]]],["SRX013125","no description for experiment design","Pooled mRNA, normalized, 454 GS-FLX Titanium chemistries","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS007367",[["SRR030395","81,351","38,482,612","473"]]]],[["SRS007366","neonate, juvenile, and adult male garter snakes",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS007367","neonate, juvenile, and adult female garter snakes",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["DRA000169",[["21088025","SAMStat: monitoring biases in next generation sequencing data","Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)","2011-Jan-1","DRA000169","The sequence alignment/map format (SAM) is a commonly used format to store the alignments between millions of short reads and a reference genome.

Many loci are known to produce overlapping coding and noncoding RNAs with capped 5' ends that vary in size. Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region. Both of these methods allow further annotation-agnostic studies of the complex human transcriptome.","Plessy C, Bertin N, Takahashi H, Simone R, Salimullah M, Lassmann T, Vitezic M, Severin J, Olivarius S, Lazarevic D, Hornig N, Orlando V, Bell I, Gao H, Dumais J, Kapranov P, Wang H, Davis CA, Gingeras TR, Kawai J, Daub CO, Hayashizaki Y, Gustincich S, Carninci P."]],["DRP000169","Sequencing-based analysis of 5′ capped ends of RNAs have unveiled an unexpected complexity of the mammalian transcriptome, in which coding and non-coding RNAs produced in loci often harboring multiple promoters coexist with processed RNAs that exhibit a variety of 5′ modifications. In light of these discoveries, assessing whether novel transcription start sites (TSSs) are alternative promoters of known genes or promoters of newly identified transcripts require dedicated approaches. Furthermore, collecting such data from limiting amount of RNAs, such as microdissected cell types or from sub-cellular compartments with ex vivo samples—a necessary step to reduce the complexity of the studied transcriptome while keeping its biological relevance—often requires quantities of starting total RNA that are not sufficient for current protocols. Addressing both challenges, we developed nanoCAGE, a 5′ ends RNA profiling method of both poly-A+ and poly-A− transcripts that operates using as little as 10 ng of total RNA, coupled with CAGEscan, a technology for a gene-agnostic exploration of the transcriptome structure and dynamics, linking de novo-assembled transcripts to their regulatory regions","While the classic CAGE protocol requires a substantial number of biochemical processing steps, CAGEscan and nanoCAGE take advantage of a peculiar property of reverse transcriptase, called “template switching” to select 5′ ends of capped transcripts. This property allows proceeding directly from the first-strand cDNA synthesis to the addition of the second-strand cDNA primer at the 5′ end of the original RNA sequence without purification steps, thereby avoiding loss of material. This approach exploits the ability of the reverse-transcriptase to extend the cDNA using the mRNA’s cap as a template: the resulting neo-synthesized first strand cDNA carries one to three C nucleotides in correspondence of the cap structure. These Cs are hybridized to the ribo-G at the 3′ end of a template switching (TS) oligonucleotide. Then, the reverse transcriptase extends cDNA polymerization using the TS oligonucleotide as template, providing extra 3′ sequences to the first-strand cDNA. Due to the selectivity of the template switch for capped molecules, both protocols were used on total RNA, without depletion of ribosomal RNAs. Notably, the usage of 3′ random primer allows the detection of non-coding, non-polyadenylated RNAs. In the CAGEscan protocol, cDNAs are not cleaved, but directly prepared for sequencing by a second PCR which adds the adapter sequences needed to bridge PCR in the Illumina Genome Analyzers. In contrast with the nanoCAGE protocol, sequencing of both the 5′ end and the 3′ end of the template-switched captured cDNAs yields collections of 3′ ends reads “scanning” transcripts that can be unequivocally defined by their common 5′ end. Yet, unlike nanoCAGE libraries that contain uniformly short sequences, CAGEscan libraries are composed of sequences of broader size range including fragments longer than 1 kb, which poorly perform on currently available second-generation sequencing platform. However, since CAGEscan exclusively uses random primers at high concentration and commercial reverse transcriptases do not have a strong strand displacement activity, CAGEscan sequencing templates prepared by our optimized protocol are kept relatively short, regardless the length of the original mRNA molecules."],[["DRX000214","no description for experiment design","no description for library

gene regulation frequently occurs through elements in mRNA 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Although crucial roles for 3'UTR-mediated gene regulation have been found in Caenorhabditis elegans, most C. elegans genes have lacked annotated 3'UTRs. Here we describe a high-throughput method for reliable identification of polyadenylated RNA termini, and we apply this method, called poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-Seq), to determine C. elegans 3'UTRs. Compared to standard methods also recently applied to C. elegans UTRs, 3P-Seq identified 8,580 additional UTRs while excluding thousands of shorter UTR isoforms that do not seem to be authentic. Analysis of this expanded and corrected data set suggested that the high A/U content of C. elegans 3'UTRs facilitated genome compaction, because the elements specifying cleavage and polyadenylation, which are A/U rich, can more readily emerge in A/U-rich regions. Indeed, 30% of the protein-coding genes have mRNAs with alternative, partially overlapping end regions that generate another 10,480 cleavage and polyadenylation sites that had gone largely unnoticed and represent potential evolutionary intermediates of progressive UTR shortening. Moreover, a third of the convergently transcribed genes use palindromic arrangements of bidirectional elements to specify UTRs with convergent overlap, which also contributes to genome compaction by eliminating regions between genes. Although nematode 3'UTRs have median length only one-sixth that of mammalian 3'UTRs, they have twice the density of conserved microRNA sites, in part because additional types of seed-complementary sites are preferentially conserved. These findings reveal the influence of cleavage and polyadenylation on the evolution of genome architecture and provide resources for studying post-transcriptional gene regulation.","Jan CH, Friedman RC, Ruby JG, Bartel DP."],["19181841","Massively parallel sequencing of the polyadenylated transcriptome of C. elegans.","Genome Res","2009-Apr","SRA003622","Using massively parallel sequencing by synthesis methods, we have surveyed the polyA+ transcripts from four stages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to an unprecedented depth.

The data provide experimental support for >85% of the annotated protein-coding transcripts in WormBase (WS170) and confirm additional details of processing. For example, the total number of confirmed splice junctions was raised from 70,911 to over 98,000. The data also suggest thousands of modifications to WormBase annotations and identify new spliced junctions and genes not part of any WormBase annotation, including at least 80 putative genes not found in any of three predicted gene sets. The quantitative nature of the data also suggests that mRNA levels may be measured by this approach with unparalleled precision. Although most sequences align with protein-coding genes, a small fraction falls in introns and intergenic regions.

In addition, a sequence contig from a novel totivirus could also be constructed. Using RT-qPCR, levels of PRV in tissue samples were quantified and the totivirus was detected in all samples tested from CMS fish but not in controls. In situ hybridization supported this pattern indicating a possible association between CMS and the novel piscine totivirus.Although causality for CMS in Atlantic salmon could not be proven for either of the two viruses, our results are compatible with a hypothesis where, in the experimental challenge studied, PRV behaves as an opportunist whereas the totivirus might be more directly linked with the development of CMS.","Løvoll M, Wiik-Nielsen J, Grove S, Wiik-Nielsen CR, Kristoffersen AB, Faller R, Poppe T, Jung J, Pedamallu CS, Nederbragt AJ, Meyerson M, Rimstad E, Tengs T."]],["SRP002117","Total RNA was sequenced from Atlantic salmon with cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) in order to look for possible infectious agent(s).","Total RNA sequenced from Atlantic salmon with cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS)"],[["SRX017741","Total RNA sequenced from Atlantic salmon with cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) was sequenced in order to identify possible infectious agent.","RNA was DNase treated using TURBO DNA-free (Applied Biosystems/Ambion) and reverse transcribed/amplified using the QuantiTect kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer%u2019s instructions.

In brief, total RNA aliquots (1 or 2 μg) were diluted in 50 uL of nuclease-free H2O and heated at 65oC for 5 min to disrupt secondary structure prior to incubation with magnetic oligo-dT beads to capture the poly-adenylated RNA fraction.  First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.  Unbound cDNA fragments were washed away prior to ligation with GEX DpnII adapter to the 5’ end of the bead-bound digested cDNA fragments. This adapter contains a restriction site for MmeI that cuts 17 bp downstream from the DpnII site.  After subsequent digestion with MmeI, 21 bp tags starting with the DpnII recognition sequence were recovered from the beads and dephosphorylated prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.  Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.  The resulting fragments were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel debris with 1× NEBuffer 2 by gentle rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Gel debris were removed using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (2 ml, 0.45 µm) and the DNA was precipitated by adding 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 325 µl of ethanol (–20°C), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After washing the pellet with 70% ethanol, the DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.5 and quantified with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.

First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.  Unbound cDNA fragments were washed away prior to ligation with GEX DpnII adapter to the 5’ end of the bead-bound digested cDNA fragments. This adapter contains a restriction site for MmeI that cuts 17 bp downstream from the DpnII site.  After subsequent digestion with MmeI, 21 bp tags starting with the DpnII recognition sequence were recovered from the beads and dephosphorylated prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.  Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.  The resulting fragments were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel debris with 1× NEBuffer 2 by gentle rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Gel debris were removed using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (2 ml, 0.45 µm) and the DNA was precipitated by adding 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 325 µl of ethanol (–20°C), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After washing the pellet with 70% ethanol, the DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.5 and quantified with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.

Residual red blood cells were removed from the buffy coat by resuspending twice in 140 mM NH4Cl; 17 mM Tris/HCl and collecting the unlysed cells by repeating centrifugation after each resuspension. All samples were stored at -80oC until sonicated or pulverized and then homogenized using a polytron homogenizer for extraction of total RNA with TRIZOL (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) using the manufacturer's protocol.  The integrity of the RNA was confirmed a 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano-chip (Agilent - Santa Clara, CA).

In brief, total RNA aliquots (1 or 2 μg) were diluted in 50 uL of nuclease-free H2O and heated at 65oC for 5 min to disrupt secondary structure prior to incubation with magnetic oligo-dT beads to capture the poly-adenylated RNA fraction.  First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.  Unbound cDNA fragments were washed away prior to ligation with GEX DpnII adapter to the 5’ end of the bead-bound digested cDNA fragments. This adapter contains a restriction site for MmeI that cuts 17 bp downstream from the DpnII site.  After subsequent digestion with MmeI, 21 bp tags starting with the DpnII recognition sequence were recovered from the beads and dephosphorylated prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.  Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.  The resulting fragments were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel debris with 1× NEBuffer 2 by gentle rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Gel debris were removed using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (2 ml, 0.45 µm) and the DNA was precipitated by adding 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 325 µl of ethanol (–20°C), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After washing the pellet with 70% ethanol, the DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.5 and quantified with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.  Sequencing using Solexa/Illumina Whole Genome SequencerCluster generation was performed after applying 4 pM of each sample to the individual lanes of the Illumina 1G flowcell.

First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.  Unbound cDNA fragments were washed away prior to ligation with GEX DpnII adapter to the 5’ end of the bead-bound digested cDNA fragments. This adapter contains a restriction site for MmeI that cuts 17 bp downstream from the DpnII site.  After subsequent digestion with MmeI, 21 bp tags starting with the DpnII recognition sequence were recovered from the beads and dephosphorylated prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.  Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.  The resulting fragments were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel debris with 1× NEBuffer 2 by gentle rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Gel debris were removed using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (2 ml, 0.45 µm) and the DNA was precipitated by adding 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 325 µl of ethanol (–20°C), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After washing the pellet with 70% ethanol, the DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.5 and quantified with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.

Residual red blood cells were removed from the buffy coat by resuspending twice in 140 mM NH4Cl; 17 mM Tris/HCl and collecting the unlysed cells by repeating centrifugation after each resuspension. All samples were stored at -80oC until sonicated or pulverized and then homogenized using a polytron homogenizer for extraction of total RNA with TRIZOL (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) using the manufacturer's protocol.  The integrity of the RNA was confirmed a 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano-chip (Agilent - Santa Clara, CA).  The samples used had an average RIN value of 8.0 and 28S:18S rRNA ratio of 1.42.\n\nTag Library Construction and Sequencing: Tag library preparation was performed at Illumina (formerly Solexa, Hayward, CA) using a progenitor version of DGE-Tag Profiling DpnII Sample Prep kit and protocol. In brief, total RNA aliquots (1 or 2 μg) were diluted in 50 uL of nuclease-free H2O and heated at 65oC for 5 min to disrupt secondary structure prior to incubation with magnetic oligo-dT beads to capture the poly-adenylated RNA fraction.  First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.  Unbound cDNA fragments were washed away prior to ligation with GEX DpnII adapter to the 5’ end of the bead-bound digested cDNA fragments. This adapter contains a restriction site for MmeI that cuts 17 bp downstream from the DpnII site.  After subsequent digestion with MmeI, 21 bp tags starting with the DpnII recognition sequence were recovered from the beads and dephosphorylated prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.  Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.  The resulting fragments were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel debris with 1× NEBuffer 2 by gentle rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Gel debris were removed using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (2 ml, 0.45 µm) and the DNA was precipitated by adding 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 325 µl of ethanol (–20°C), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After washing the pellet with 70% ethanol, the DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.5 and quantified with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.  Sequencing using Solexa/Illumina Whole Genome SequencerCluster generation was performed after applying 4 pM of each sample to the individual lanes of the Illumina 1G flowcell.

We describe here the transcriptional regulatory circuitry of ES cells that incorporates protein-coding and miRNA genes based on high-resolution ChIP-seq data, systematic identification of miRNA promoters, and quantitative sequencing of short transcripts in multiple cell types. We find that the key ES cell transcription factors are associated with promoters for miRNAs that are preferentially expressed in ES cells and with promoters for a set of silent miRNA genes. This silent set of miRNA genes is co-occupied by Polycomb group proteins in ES cells and shows tissue-specific expression in differentiated cells. These data reveal how key ES cell transcription factors promote the ES cell miRNA expression program and integrate miRNAs into the regulatory circuitry controlling ES cell identity.","Marson A, Levine SS, Cole MF, Frampton GM, Brambrink T, Johnstone S, Guenther MG, Johnston WK, Wernig M, Newman J, Calabrese JM, Dennis LM, Volkert TL, Gupta S, Love J, Hannett N, Sharp PA, Bartel DP, Jaenisch R, Young RA."]],["SRP001121","no study abstract","miRNA sequencing from murine embryonic stem cells (mES, v6.5), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), murine neural precursor cells (NPC), and ZHBT-c4 cells (from Austin Smith) untreated (0h), with 12 hours of doxycyclin treatment (12h), and with 24 hours of doxycyclin treatment (24h)."],[["SRX008325","no description for experiment design","Single-stranded cDNA libraries of short transcripts were generated using size selected RNA.

We also detected endo-siRNAs complementary to messenger RNAs (mRNAs); these siRNAs disproportionately mapped to the complementary regions of overlapping mRNAs predicted to form double-stranded RNA in vivo. Normal accumulation of somatic endo-siRNAs requires the siRNA-generating ribonuclease Dicer-2 and the RNAi effector protein Argonaute2 (Ago2). We propose that endo-siRNAs generated by the fly RNAi pathway silence selfish genetic elements in the soma, much as Piwi-interacting RNAs do in the germ line.","Ghildiyal M, Seitz H, Horwich MD, Li C, Du T, Lee S, Xu J, Kittler EL, Zapp ML, Weng Z, Zamore PD."]],["SRP000181","no study abstract","Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct RNA interference (RNAi) in eukaryotes.

Despite being rich data sources, they have not been used much due to the difficulty in locating and analyzing datasets of interest.Geoseq http://geoseq.mssm.edu provides a new method of analyzing short reads from deep sequencing experiments. Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. It is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. The analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs. The ease of using Geoseq for these analyses suggests its utility and uniqueness as an analysis tool.","Gurtowski J, Cancio A, Shah H, Levovitz C, George A, Homann R, Sachidanandam R."],["19169241","Post-transcriptional processing generates a diversity of 5'-modified long and short RNAs.","Nature","2009-Feb-19","SRA008169","The transcriptomes of eukaryotic cells are incredibly complex. Individual non-coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein-coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure. Deep sequencing of small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE (cap-analysis of gene expression) tags, which mark the 5' ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter-associated small RNAs, appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and non-coding genes, sometimes crossing exon-exon junctions. Here we show that processing of mature mRNAs through an as yet unknown mechanism may generate complex populations of both long and short RNAs whose apparently capped 5' ends coincide. Supplying synthetic promoter-associated small RNAs corresponding to the c-MYC transcriptional start site reduced MYC messenger RNA abundance. The studies presented here expand the catalogue of cellular small RNAs and demonstrate a biological impact for at least one class of non-canonical small RNAs.","Affymetrix ENCODE Transcriptome Project; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ENCODE Transcriptome Project."]],["SRP000599","no study abstract","We report an applicaton of small RNA sequencing using high throughput next generation sequencing to identify the small RNA content of cell lines.

Extensive double-stranded character, as is found in small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), directs duplexes into Ago2, whereas central mismatches, like those found in miRNA/miRNA* duplexes, direct duplexes into Ago1. Central to this sorting decision is the affinity of the small RNA duplex for the Dcr-2/R2D2 heterodimer, which loads small RNAs into Ago2. Here, we show that while most Drosophila miRNAs are bound to Ago1, miRNA* strands accumulate bound to Ago2. Like siRNA loading, efficient loading of miRNA* strands in Ago2 favors duplexes with a paired central region and requires both Dcr-2 and R2D2. Those miRNA and miRNA* sequences bound to Ago2, like siRNAs diced in vivo from long double-stranded RNA, typically begin with cytidine, whereas Ago1-bound miRNA and miRNA* disproportionately begin with uridine. Consequently, some pre-miRNA generate two or more isoforms from the same side of the stem that differentially partition between Ago1 and Ago2. Our findings provide the first genome-wide test for the idea that Drosophila small RNAs are sorted between Ago1 and Ago2 according to their duplex structure and the identity of their first nucleotide.  Overall Design: Sequencing of small RNAs (either total small RNAs or Ago1-associated small RNAs) in wild-type, dcr-2 and r2d2 mutant flies.

Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. It is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. The analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the translation of their mRNA targets, and are therefore candidates for mediating this control process. While the expression and importance of miRNAs in T and B lymphocytes have been established, little is known about miRNAs in NK cells. Here, we used two next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms to define the miRNA transcriptomes of resting and cytokine-activated primary murine NK cells, with confirmation by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and microarrays. We delineate a bioinformatics analysis pipeline that identified 302 known and 21 novel mature miRNAs from sequences obtained from NK cell small RNA libraries. These miRNAs are expressed over a broad range and exhibit isomiR complexity, and a subset is differentially expressed following cytokine activation. Using these miRNA NGS data, miR-223 was identified as a mature miRNA present in resting NK cells with decreased expression following cytokine activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-223 specifically targets the 3' untranslated region of murine GzmB in vitro, indicating that this miRNA may contribute to control of GzmB translation in resting NK cells.

As an example, intercrosses of certain Drosophila virilis strains can produce dysgenic progeny. The Penelope element is present only in a subset of laboratory strains and has been implicated as a causative agent of the dysgenic phenotype. We have also introduced Penelope into Drosophila melanogaster, which are otherwise naive to the element. We have taken advantage of these natural and experimentally induced colonization processes to probe the evolution of small RNA pathways in response to transposon challenge. In both species, Penelope was predominantly targeted by endo-small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) rather than by piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Although we do observe correlations between Penelope transcription and dysgenesis, we could not correlate differences in maternally deposited Penelope piRNAs with the sterility of progeny. Instead, we found that strains that produced dysgenic progeny differed in their production of piRNAs from clusters in subtelomeric regions, possibly indicating that changes in the overall piRNA repertoire underlie dysgenesis.

Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region.

The volume of water was reduced to 2 microl by centrifugal evaporation at room temperature in the presence of 0.66 M D- Threalose (Nacalai Tesque), 3.3 M D-Sorbitol (WAKO), 100 microM of TS oligonucleotide TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGCA(rG)(rG)(rG), 10 microM of random RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCTN15 (Stangegaard et al., 2006) or 10 microM of polythimine RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT18. The oligonucleotides were added at this step because it helps to keep the final reaction volume low. They contain binding sites for the type III restriction enzyme EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992), indicated in bold, that will be used to extract 5' tags from the cDNAs. Trehalose and sorbitol protect RNAs against degradation and capture on tube walls by preventing the samples from drying completely. Furthermore, these poly-hydroxylated molecules thermoactivate the reverse transcriptase (RTase) at the next step (Carninci et al., 1998). The mixture was then was heat-denatured at 65 deg_C for 10 min in a thermocycler (MWG) and transferred quickly on a ice/water mixture, to avoid the formation  of  secondary  structures.  Reverse transcription and template switching were accomplished together in a volume of 10 microl with the following components: 1.25 x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 650 nM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 1.3 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 925 mM betaine (Spiess and Ivell, 2002) (WAKO) , and 200 units of SuperScriptII (Invitrogen). The reactions were incubated at 22 deg_C for 10 min, 50 deg_C for 30 min, 75 deg_C for 15 min in a thermocycler., and then immediately transferred on a ice/water mix. To prepare the second strand synthesis and amplification of the cDNAs, a small scale semi-suppressive PCR reaction was performed to evaluate the optimal number of cycles, defined as the last cycle before the intensity of the product ceases to increase. 10 microl aliquots were taken every two cycles and analyzed on 1% agarose gel. For each cDNA preparation, 2 microl of first strand cDNA were amplified in reactions of 100 microl using a mixture containing 1 x ExTaq Buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 100 nM forward PCR primer TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGC, 100 nM reverse PCR primer primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT, and 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa) with the following thermocycling program: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 15 s at 65 deg_C, 2 min at 68 deg_C) and using hot start. The rest of the cDNAs (6 microl each) were then processed in 4 reactions of 100 microl with the chosen number of cycles. PCR products were pooled and cleaned using CTAB and GE Healthcare GFX purification columns (to be published elsewhere). Tags were prepared from 45 microl of cDNA by enzymatic cleavage in 100 microl using 100 units of EcoP15I (NEB), 1 x buffer 3 (NEB), 1 mM ATP (NEB) and 100 ng/microl BSA (NEB), at 37 deg_C for 4 hours. We chose EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992) for tag generation, as it was reported to cut 25/27 bases downstream its binding site (Matsumura et al., 2003). In addition its non-palindromic DNA binding site strongly reduces the opportunities for the formation of PCR primer dimers during subsequent steps. Reactions were mixed with 130 microl of TE buffer and the low molecular weight cleavage products were purified through the Microcon YM-100 membranes (Millipore) by spinning 15 min at 500 x g. The columns were filled again with 130 microl of TE buffer and spun 15 min at 500 x g. The flow-through was then concentrated on Microcon YM-10 (Millipore) by spinning 20 min at 12,000 x g. The low molecular weight cleavage products were recovered by spinning 3 min at 1000 x g after flipping the cartridges. Ligation adapters were annealed by mixing equimolar amounts of two oligonucleotides, NNAGCTGTAGAACTCTGAACCTGT and ACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGCT, in a thermocycler at 95 deg_C and left to cool down to room temperature. 1 pmol of adapters was ligated to 10 microl of the EcoP15I cleavage products in 20 microl of 0.5 x \"Mighty\" DNA ligation mixture (TaKaRa) overnight at 16 deg_C in a thermocycler with lid heater (MWG). Optimal number of cycles for the ligation product to be amplified was determined  by  PCR  with  5 microM  of  forward  PCR  primer AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAG, 5 microM of  reverse  PCR  primer CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGATAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAG, 1 x ExTaq buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa). The program was: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 10 s at 68 deg_C). 3 PCR reactions in 100 microl for each sample were performed. The excess of the primers was digested with 5 units of Exonuclease I (TaKaRa) at 37 deg_C for 30 min and then the enzyme was heat inactivated at 55 deg_C for 15 min. Then the PCR products were purified by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel and the band corresponding to the expected size (114 bp) was cut, passed through a syringe to break the structure of polyacrylamide, and the DNA was extracted at room temperature in a microtube on rotation with 800 microl of 1 x TE buffer over night. The tubes were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. 600 microl of 1 x TE buffer were added to the polyacrylamide in the microtube and let to rotate at room temperature for 1 hour. This step was repeated once more. Then for each sample, all the collected fractions were pooled together and passed through a Microspin filter (GE Healthcare) to eliminate residual traces of polyacrylamide. A total of 2 ml of filtrate was concentrated to 100 microl passing through a Microcon YM-10 column (Millipore). The purity and the concentration of the sample was estimated by Nanodrop UV spectrophotometer and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and an aliquot of 10 microl was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to check for the correct size of the recovered DNA.\"","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS002650",[["SRR017226","4,314,825","155,333,700","36"]]],["SRX003891","\"nanoCAGE libraries prepared with a serial dillution of Hep G2 total RNA: 1250, 250, 50 or 10 ng.

Reverse transcription and template switching were accomplished together in a volume of 10 microl with the following components: 1.25 x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 650 nM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 1.3 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 925 mM betaine (Spiess and Ivell, 2002) (WAKO) , and 200 units of SuperScriptII (Invitrogen).

To prepare the second strand synthesis and amplification of the cDNAs, a small scale semi-suppressive PCR reaction was performed to evaluate the optimal number of cycles, defined as the last cycle before the intensity of the product ceases to increase. 10 microl aliquots were taken every two cycles and analyzed on 1% agarose gel. For each cDNA preparation, 2 microl of first strand cDNA were amplified in reactions of 100 microl using a mixture containing 1 x ExTaq Buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 100 nM forward PCR primer TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGC, 100 nM reverse PCR primer primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT, and 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa) with the following thermocycling program: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 15 s at 65 deg_C, 2 min at 68 deg_C) and using hot start. The rest of the cDNAs (6 microl each) were then processed in 4 reactions of 100 microl with the chosen number of cycles. PCR products were pooled and cleaned using CTAB and GE Healthcare GFX purification columns (to be published elsewhere). Tags were prepared from 45 microl of cDNA by enzymatic cleavage in 100 microl using 100 units of EcoP15I (NEB), 1 x buffer 3 (NEB), 1 mM ATP (NEB) and 100 ng/microl BSA (NEB), at 37 deg_C for 4 hours. We chose EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992) for tag generation, as it was reported to cut 25/27 bases downstream its binding site (Matsumura et al., 2003). In addition its non-palindromic DNA binding site strongly reduces the opportunities for the formation of PCR primer dimers during subsequent steps. Reactions were mixed with 130 microl of TE buffer and the low molecular weight cleavage products were purified through the Microcon YM-100 membranes (Millipore) by spinning 15 min at 500 x g. The columns were filled again with 130 microl of TE buffer and spun 15 min at 500 x g. The flow-through was then concentrated on Microcon YM-10 (Millipore) by spinning 20 min at 12,000 x g. The low molecular weight cleavage products were recovered by spinning 3 min at 1000 x g after flipping the cartridges. Ligation adapters were annealed by mixing equimolar amounts of two oligonucleotides, NNAGCTGTAGAACTCTGAACCTGT and ACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGCT, in a thermocycler at 95 deg_C and left to cool down to room temperature. 1 pmol of adapters was ligated to 10 microl of the EcoP15I cleavage products in 20 microl of 0.5 x \"Mighty\" DNA ligation mixture (TaKaRa) overnight at 16 deg_C in a thermocycler with lid heater (MWG). Optimal number of cycles for the ligation product to be amplified was determined  by  PCR  with  5 microM  of  forward  PCR  primer AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAG, 5 microM of  reverse  PCR  primer CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGATAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAG, 1 x ExTaq buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa). The program was: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 10 s at 68 deg_C). 3 PCR reactions in 100 microl for each sample were performed. The excess of the primers was digested with 5 units of Exonuclease I (TaKaRa) at 37 deg_C for 30 min and then the enzyme was heat inactivated at 55 deg_C for 15 min. Then the PCR products were purified by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel and the band corresponding to the expected size (114 bp) was cut, passed through a syringe to break the structure of polyacrylamide, and the DNA was extracted at room temperature in a microtube on rotation with 800 microl of 1 x TE buffer over night. The tubes were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. 600 microl of 1 x TE buffer were added to the polyacrylamide in the microtube and let to rotate at room temperature for 1 hour. This step was repeated once more. Then for each sample, all the collected fractions were pooled together and passed through a Microspin filter (GE Healthcare) to eliminate residual traces of polyacrylamide. A total of 2 ml of filtrate was concentrated to 100 microl passing through a Microcon YM-10 column (Millipore).

Many loci are known to produce overlapping coding and noncoding RNAs with capped 5' ends that vary in size. Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region. Both of these methods allow further annotation-agnostic studies of the complex human transcriptome.","Plessy C, Bertin N, Takahashi H, Simone R, Salimullah M, Lassmann T, Vitezic M, Severin J, Olivarius S, Lazarevic D, Hornig N, Orlando V, Bell I, Gao H, Dumais J, Kapranov P, Wang H, Davis CA, Gingeras TR, Kawai J, Daub CO, Hayashizaki Y, Gustincich S, Carninci P."]],["DRP000169","Sequencing-based analysis of 5′ capped ends of RNAs have unveiled an unexpected complexity of the mammalian transcriptome, in which coding and non-coding RNAs produced in loci often harboring multiple promoters coexist with processed RNAs that exhibit a variety of 5′ modifications. In light of these discoveries, assessing whether novel transcription start sites (TSSs) are alternative promoters of known genes or promoters of newly identified transcripts require dedicated approaches. Furthermore, collecting such data from limiting amount of RNAs, such as microdissected cell types or from sub-cellular compartments with ex vivo samples—a necessary step to reduce the complexity of the studied transcriptome while keeping its biological relevance—often requires quantities of starting total RNA that are not sufficient for current protocols. Addressing both challenges, we developed nanoCAGE, a 5′ ends RNA profiling method of both poly-A+ and poly-A− transcripts that operates using as little as 10 ng of total RNA, coupled with CAGEscan, a technology for a gene-agnostic exploration of the transcriptome structure and dynamics, linking de novo-assembled transcripts to their regulatory regions","While the classic CAGE protocol requires a substantial number of biochemical processing steps, CAGEscan and nanoCAGE take advantage of a peculiar property of reverse transcriptase, called “template switching” to select 5′ ends of capped transcripts. This property allows proceeding directly from the first-strand cDNA synthesis to the addition of the second-strand cDNA primer at the 5′ end of the original RNA sequence without purification steps, thereby avoiding loss of material. This approach exploits the ability of the reverse-transcriptase to extend the cDNA using the mRNA’s cap as a template: the resulting neo-synthesized first strand cDNA carries one to three C nucleotides in correspondence of the cap structure. These Cs are hybridized to the ribo-G at the 3′ end of a template switching (TS) oligonucleotide. Then, the reverse transcriptase extends cDNA polymerization using the TS oligonucleotide as template, providing extra 3′ sequences to the first-strand cDNA. Due to the selectivity of the template switch for capped molecules, both protocols were used on total RNA, without depletion of ribosomal RNAs. Notably, the usage of 3′ random primer allows the detection of non-coding, non-polyadenylated RNAs. In the CAGEscan protocol, cDNAs are not cleaved, but directly prepared for sequencing by a second PCR which adds the adapter sequences needed to bridge PCR in the Illumina Genome Analyzers. In contrast with the nanoCAGE protocol, sequencing of both the 5′ end and the 3′ end of the template-switched captured cDNAs yields collections of 3′ ends reads “scanning” transcripts that can be unequivocally defined by their common 5′ end. Yet, unlike nanoCAGE libraries that contain uniformly short sequences, CAGEscan libraries are composed of sequences of broader size range including fragments longer than 1 kb, which poorly perform on currently available second-generation sequencing platform. However, since CAGEscan exclusively uses random primers at high concentration and commercial reverse transcriptases do not have a strong strand displacement activity, CAGEscan sequencing templates prepared by our optimized protocol are kept relatively short, regardless the length of the original mRNA molecules."],[["DRX000214","no description for experiment design","no description for library

Together, these modifications increase the efficiency of photosynthesis, and despite the apparent complexity of the pathway, it has evolved at least 45 times independently within the angiosperms. To provide insight into the extent to which gene expression is altered between C(3) and C(4) leaves, and to identify candidates associated with the C(4) pathway, we used massively parallel mRNA sequencing of closely related C(3) (Cleome spinosa) and C(4) (Cleome gynandra) species. Gene annotation was facilitated by the phylogenetic proximity of Cleome and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Up to 603 transcripts differ in abundance between these C(3) and C(4) leaves. These include 17 transcription factors, putative transport proteins, as well as genes that in Arabidopsis are implicated in chloroplast movement and expansion, plasmodesmatal connectivity, and cell wall modification. These are all characteristics known to alter in a C(4) leaf but that previously had remained undefined at the molecular level. We also document large shifts in overall transcription profiles for selected functional classes. Our approach defines the extent to which transcript abundance in these C(3) and C(4) leaves differs, provides a blueprint for the NAD-malic enzyme C(4) pathway operating in a dicotyledon, and furthermore identifies potential regulators. We anticipate that comparative transcriptomics of closely related species will provide deep insight into the evolution of other complex traits.","Bräutigam A, Kajala K, Wullenweber J, Sommer M, Gagneul D, Weber KL, Carr KM, Gowik U, Mass J, Lercher MJ, Westhoff P, Hibberd JM, Weber AP."]],["SRP000735","To provide insight into the extent to which gene expression is altered between C3 and C4 species, and to identify candidates underlying the alterations in a C4 leaf compared to C3 leaf we have used RNA-seq of closely related C3 and C4 species from the genus Cleome.

Digital gene expression analysis is based on the random generation of sequence tags that are proportional to the abundance of the corresponding transcripts in a particular sample. Pyrosequencing has previously been shown to be useful in defining transcriptomes of sequenced as well as incompletely sequenced plant species and here we show that it can be used for differential analysis of gene expression of related species. For our analysis, we used C3 and C4 members of Cleome, a genus that contains the most closely related C4 species to Arabidopsis thaliana. The rationale for using Cleome in this approach was that its phylogenetic proximity to A. thaliana should facilitate annotation and interpretation of sequence data obtained. In addition, Cleome gynandra represents the first dicotyledonous C4 species, and member of the NAD-Malic Enzyme (NAD-ME) sub-type of C4 photosynthesis for which a comprehensive and quantitative transcriptome dataset is available."],[["SRX004114","Shotgun sequencing of uncloned cDNA using 454.","Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 28 day old plants.  mRNA was selected by two rounds of oligo(dT) purification.  cDNA was synthesized using the Clontech SMART cDNA Libary Construction kit.  dscDNA was prepared for pyrosequencing using the standard 454 shotgun library preparation kit.","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS002743",[["SRR015531","313,805","84,570,023","269"]]],["SRX004115","Shotgun sequencing of uncloned cDNA using 454.","Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 28 day old plants.  mRNA was selected by two rounds of oligo(dT) purification.  cDNA was synthesized using the Clontech SMART cDNA Libary Construction kit.  dscDNA was prepared for pyrosequencing using the standard 454 shotgun library preparation kit.","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS002744",[["SRR015532","402,668","108,272,468","268"]]]],[["SRS002743","Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 28 day old plants in the vegetative state.  mRNA was isolated by two rounds of oligo(dT) purification, reverse transcribed into cDNA and prepared for 454 sequencing.",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS002744","Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 28 day old plants in the vegetative state.  mRNA was isolated by two rounds of oligo(dT) purification, reverse transcribed into cDNA and prepared for 454 sequencing.",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA010777",[["20540116","Rapid transcriptome and proteome profiling of a non-model marine invertebrate, Bugula neritina.","Proteomics","2010-Aug","SRA010777","Non-model organisms represent the majority of life forms in our planet.

BLAST sequence similarity searching assigned putative function to 17% of the data set, with a significant proportion of these transcripts being involved in binding and potentially of a secretory nature, as defined by GO molecular function and biological process classifications. These results indicated that the mantle is a transcriptionally active tissue which is actively proliferating. All transcripts were screened against an in-house database of genes shown to be involved in extracellular matrix formation and calcium homeostasis in metazoans.

RNA was precipitated using a 1:1 isopropanol:saline solution (1:1 0.8 M sodium citrate and 1.2 M NaCl) and after resuspension, the RNA was subjected to a further precipitation using 250 mkl 7.5 M LiCl. The extractions were further cleaned using RNeasy mini kit columns (Qiagen, Crawley, Sussex, UK) following manufacturer instructions in order to eliminate LiCl and salt residues. 5mkg of RNA was PCR amplified using the protocol described in [78] prior to preparation for the 454 run. Samples were nebulised at 30psi for one minute and subsequently purified with Ampure (Agencourt) to produce fragments 300 bp and above. The ends were polished and the 454 titananium adapters containing specific MID sequences were attached. Fragments containing both a and b adapters were selected and quantified .

Similarly, the biosynthetic pathway of oxalate, the main by-product during scleroglucan production, has not been elucidated yet. In order to provide a basis for genetic and metabolic engineering approaches, we studied scleroglucan and oxalate biosynthesis in S. rolfsii using different transcriptomic approaches.Two S. rolfsii transcriptomes obtained from scleroglucan-producing and scleroglucan-nonproducing conditions were pooled and sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing technique yielding approximately 350,000 reads. These could be assembled into 21,937 contigs and 171,833 singletons, for which 6,951 had significant matches in public protein data bases. Sequence data were used to obtain first insights into the genomics of scleroglucan and oxalate production and to predict putative proteins involved in the synthesis of both metabolites. Using comparative transcriptomics, namely Agilent microarray hybridization and suppression subtractive hybridization, we identified approximately 800 unigenes which are differently expressed under scleroglucan-producing and non-producing conditions. From these, candidate genes were identified which could represent potential leads for targeted modification of the S. rolfsii metabolism for increased scleroglucan yields.The results presented in this paper provide for the first time genomic and transcriptomic data about S. rolfsii and demonstrate the power and usefulness of combined transcriptome sequencing and comparative microarray analysis. The data obtained allowed us to predict the biosynthetic pathways of scleroglucan and oxalate synthesis and to identify important genes putatively involved in determining scleroglucan yields.

Collection of genome-scale data for land plants and other organisms over the past decade has invigorated the field of evolutionary biology. One of the core questions in the field asks: how did a colonization event by a green algae over 450 mya lead to one of the most successful lineages on the tree of life? This question can best be answered using the comparative method, the first step of which is to gather genome-scale data across closely related lineages to land plants. Before sequencing an entire genome it is useful to first gather transcriptome data: it is less expensive, it targets the protein coding regions of the genome, and provides support for gene models for future genome sequencing. We built Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) libraries for two charophyte species, Coleochaete orbicularis (Coleochaetales) and Spirogyra pratensis (Zygnematales).

MuSICA 2 performs a hybrid assembly in which an external de novo assembler is run first and the result is then improved by reference alignment of shotgun reads.

The exon-intron structure of the coding sequence was correct for more than 95% of the clones with coding sequence annotation when we excluded cDNA clones insufficiently represented in the shotgun library due to PCR failure (42 out of 200 clones excluded), and the nucleotide-level accuracy of coding sequences of those correct clones was over 99.99%.

Sequencing runs using two normalized cDNA collections from a genetically diverse pool of larvae, pupae, and adults yielded 608,053 ESTs (mean length =110 nucleotides), which assembled into 48,354 contigs (sets of overlapping DNA segments) and 59,943 singletons.

Average depth of coverage was 6.5 fold for the longest 4,800 contigs (348 to 2,849 bps in length), sufficient for detecting large numbers of SNPs.  Oligonucleotide microarray probes designed from the assembled sequences showed highly repeatable hybridization intensity and revealed biological differences among individuals.

To better understand hookworm biology and nematode parasitism, the present study generated a near complete transcriptome of the canine hookworm Ancylostoma caninum to a very high coverage using high throughput technology, and compared it to those of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the parasite Brugia malayi.The generated transcripts from four developmental stages, infective L3, serum stimulated L3, adult male and adult female, covered 93% of the A. caninum transcriptome. The broad diversity among nematode transcriptomes was confirmed, and an impact of parasitic adaptation on transcriptome diversity was inferred. Intra-population analysis showed that A. caninum has higher coding sequence diversity than humans. Examining the developmental expression profiles of A. caninum revealed major transitions in gene expression from larval stages to adult. Adult males expressed the highest number of selectively expressed genes, but adult female expressed the highest number of selective parasitism-related genes. Genes related to parasitism adaptation and A. caninum specific genes exhibited more expression selectivity while those conserved in nematodes tend to be consistently expressed. Parasitism related genes were expressed more selectively in adult male and female worms. The comprehensive analysis of digital expression profiles along with transcriptome comparisons enabled identification of a set of parasitism genes encoding secretory proteins in animal parasitic nematode.This study validated the usage of deep sequencing for gene expression profiling. Parasitic adaptation of the canine hookworm is related to its diversity and developmental dynamics. This comprehensive comparative genomic and expression study substantially improves our understanding of the basic biology and parasitism of hookworms and, is expected, in the long run, to accelerate research toward development of vaccines and novel anthelmintics.","Wang Z, Abubucker S, Martin J, Wilson RK, Hawdon J, Mitreva M."]],["SRP000096","none provided","none provided"],[["SRX000115","454 Sequencing of Ancylostoma caninum EST Library","\n          none provided\n        ","GS FLX","Base Space","SRS000288",[["SRR000611","658","165,061","250"],["SRR000612","680","171,590","252"],["SRR000614","160","39,688","248"],["SRR000618","503","127,735","253"],["SRR000619","102,978","25,790,529","250"],["SRR000622","1,530","388,337","253"],["SRR000626","169,727","42,385,415","249"],["SRR000634","225","56,222","249"]]],["SRX000116","454 Sequencing of Ancylostoma caninum EST Library","\n          none provided\n        ","GS FLX","Base Space","SRS000288",[["SRR000610","131,234","33,828,598","257"],["SRR000615","3,280","844,590","257"],["SRR000625","2,598","667,199","256"],["SRR000627","132,907","34,286,854","257"],["SRR000630","4,658","1,205,250","258"],["SRR000631","3,529","906,497","256"]]],["SRX000117","454 Sequencing of Ancylostoma caninum EST Library","\n          none provided\n        ","GS FLX","Base Space","SRS000288",[["SRR000616","5,794","1,505,666","259"],["SRR000617","1,160","300,895","259"],["SRR000620","218,104","56,118,335","257"],["SRR000621","2,001","517,585","258"],["SRR000623","247,999","63,828,225","257"],["SRR000629","2,571","668,059","259"]]],["SRX000118","454 Sequencing of Ancylostoma caninum EST Library","\n          none provided\n        ","GS FLX","Base Space","SRS000288",[["SRR000609","842","218,814","259"],["SRR000613","390","100,623","258"],["SRR000624","2,664","689,624","258"],["SRR000628","1,520","392,859","258"],["SRR000632","242,772","62,417,523","257"],["SRR000633","212,018","54,592,009","257"]]]],[["SRS000288","none provided",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA009986",[["20466808","Deep sequencing reveals differential expression of microRNAs in favorable versus unfavorable neuroblastoma.","Nucleic Acids Res","2010-Sep-1","SRA009986","Small non-coding RNAs, in particular microRNAs(miRNAs), regulate fine-tuning of gene expression and can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.

We analyzed the small RNA transcriptomes of five favorable and five unfavorable NBs using SOLiD next-generation sequencing, generating a total of >188 000 000 reads. MiRNA expression profiles obtained by deep sequencing correlated well with real-time PCR data. Cluster analysis differentiated between favorable and unfavorable NBs, and the miRNA transcriptomes of these two groups were significantly different. Oncogenic miRNAs of the miR17-92 cluster and the miR-181 family were overexpressed in unfavorable NBs. In contrast, the putative tumor suppressive microRNAs, miR-542-5p and miR-628, were expressed in favorable NBs and virtually absent in unfavorable NBs. In-depth sequence analysis revealed extensive post-transcriptional miRNA editing. Of 13 identified novel miRNAs, three were further analyzed, and expression could be confirmed in a cohort of 70 NBs.","Schulte JH, Marschall T, Martin M, Rosenstiel P, Mestdagh P, Schlierf S, Thor T, Vandesompele J, Eggert A, Schreiber S, Rahmann S, Schramm A."]],["SRP001350","Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor with highly variable clinical courses.

Total RNA was then isolated by a phase separation procedure, after sequential addition of 1 volume of buffered-saturated phenol and 1/5 volume of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The total RNA extract was further purified onto PureLink™ Micro-to Midi™ cartridges (Invitrogen). Double-strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the SMART approach.  Library subtraction was performed by Evrogen (Moscow, Russia) by using the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) method (http://www.evrogen.com/technologies/SSH.shtml). The “initiation phase culture” was assigned as the Tester; the stationary phase culture was assigned as the Driver. For both conditions, double-strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the SMART approach. The SMART Oligo II oligonucleotide and the CDS-oligo-dT primer were used for first-strand cDNA synthesis. In both cases, first-strand cDNA synthesis was started from 0.3 µg RNA in a total reaction volume of 10 µl. One µl of 5-times diluted first-strand cDNA was then used for PCR amplification with SMART PCR primer: 18 PCR cycles (each cycle included 95°C for 7 sec; 65°C for 20 sec; 72°C for 3 min) were performed. SMART-amplified cDNA samples were further digested by Rsa I endonuclease. Then, two tester populations were created by ligation of different suppression adapters (Adapters 1 and 2R). These Tester populations were mixed with 30X “Driver” cDNA excess (“driver” cDNA had no adapters), denatured and allowed to re-nature (first hybridization); as a result, abundant (redundant) molecules hybridize together and are “removed” for the second, following, hybridization stage. The second hybridization is performed after mixing the two first-hybridized samples: the scarce single-strand cDNA left over after the first hybridization, are allowed to hybridize together, eventually forming Tester-Tester hetero-hybrids with Adapter 1 at 5’-end of one strand and Adapter 2R at the 5’-end of the complementary strand.

Substantial chemical differences in and between Solanum species and glandular trichome types are likely determined by regulation of metabolism at several levels. Comparison of S. habrochaites type 1 and 4 glandular trichomes revealed few differences in chemical content or transcript abundance, leading to the conclusion that these two glandular trichome types are the same and differ perhaps only in stalk length. The observation that all the other species examined here contain either type 1 or 4 trichomes (not both) supports the conclusion that these two trichome types are the same. Most differences in metabolites between type 1 and 4 glands on the one hand and type 6 glands on the other are quantitative but not qualitative. Several glandular trichome types express genes associated with photosynthesis and carbon fixation, indicating that some carbon destined for specialized metabolism is likely fixed within the trichome secretory cells.

The main limitation of this approach is that examples from both classes are required which might be infeasible in certain cases, especially those dealing with biological data. Such is the case for membrane-binding peripheral domains that play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking by reversibly binding to membranes. For these domains, a well-defined positive set is available with domains known to bind membrane along with a large unlabeled set of domains whose membrane binding affinities have not been measured. The aforementioned limitation can be addressed by a special class of semi-supervised machine learning called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning that uses a positive set with a large unlabeled set. METHODS In this study, we implement the first application of PU-learning to a protein function prediction problem: identification of peripheral domains. PU-learning starts by identifying reliable negative (RN) examples iteratively from the unlabeled set until convergence and builds a classifier using the positive and the final RN set. A data set of 232 positive cases and ~3750 unlabeled ones were used to construct and validate the protocol.Holdout evaluation of the protocol on a left-out positive set showed that the accuracy of prediction reached up to 95% during two independent implementations.These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains.

For the randomly primed (RP) cDNA libraries the first cDNA strand was synthesized using 1 ug of poly(A) mRNA essentially free of rRNA, random hexamer primers (300 ng per each ug of RNA), and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen). The second strand of cDNA was synthesized using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) by combining 20 uL of the 1st strand reaction, 8 uL of 10x Klenow Buffer (NEB), 1 unit of RNAse H (Invitrogen), 68.8 uL of water and 30 units of DNA Polymerase I (NEB).

Several MIRNA families are conserved deeply through land plants, but many are present only in closely related species or are species specific. The finding of numerous evolutionarily young MIRNA, many with low expression and few if any targets, supports a rapid birth-death model for MIRNA evolution. A systematic analysis of MIRNA genes and families in the close relatives, Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, was conducted using both whole-genome comparisons and high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs. Orthologs of 143 A. thaliana MIRNA genes were identified in A. lyrata, with nine having significant sequence or processing changes that likely alter function. In addition, at least 13% of MIRNA genes in each species are unique, despite their relatively recent speciation (approximately 10 million years ago). Alignment of MIRNA foldbacks to the Arabidopsis genomes revealed evidence for recent origins of 32 families by inverted or direct duplication of mostly protein-coding gene sequences, but less than half of these yield miRNA that are predicted to target transcripts from the originating gene family. miRNA nucleotide divergence between A. lyrata and A. thaliana orthologs was higher for young MIRNA genes, consistent with reduced purifying selection compared with deeply conserved MIRNA genes. Additionally, target sites of younger miRNA were lost more frequently than for deeply conserved families.

Some miRNAs are well conserved among different plant lineages, whereas others are less conserved, and it is not clear whether less-conserved miRNAs have the same functionality as the well conserved ones. p4-siRNAs are broadly produced in the Arabidopsis genome, sometimes from active hot spot loci, but it is unknown whether individual p4-siRNA hot spots are retained as hot spots between plant species. In this study, we compare small RNAs in two closely related species (Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata) and find that less-conserved miRNAs have high rates of divergence in MIRNA hairpin structures, mature miRNA sequences, and target-complementary sites in the other species. The fidelity of miRNA biogenesis from many less-conserved MIRNA hairpins frequently deteriorates in the sister species relative to the species of first discovery. We also observe that p4-siRNA occupied loci have a slight tendency to be retained as p4-siRNA loci between species, but the most active A. lyrata p4-siRNA hot spots are generally not syntenic to the most active p4-siRNA hot spots of A. thaliana.

We generated more than 100 million 36-base TSS-tag sequences and revealed comprehensive features of hypoxia responsive alterations in the transcriptional landscape of the human genome. The features include presence of inducible 'hot regions' in 54 genomic regions, 220 novel hypoxia inducible promoters that may drive non-protein-coding transcripts, 191 hypoxia responsive alternative promoters and detailed views of 120 novel as well as known hypoxia responsive genes. We further analyzed hypoxic response of different cells using additional 60 million TSS-tags and found that the degree of the gene-expression changes were different among cell lines, possibly reflecting cellular robustness against hypoxia.

A distinction has been made between endogenous RNAi-related pathways and the exogenous RNAi pathway, the latter being essential for the experimental use of RNAi. Previous studies have shown that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, a complex containing the enzymes Dicer and the Argonaute RDE-1 process dsRNA. Dicer is responsible for cleaving dsRNA into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) while RDE-1 acts as the siRNA acceptor. RDE-1 then guides a multi-protein complex to homologous targets to trigger mRNA destabilization. However, endogenous role(s) for RDE-1, if any, have remained unexplored. We here show that RDE-1 functions as a scavenger protein, taking up small RNA molecules from many different sources, including the microRNA (miRNA) pathway. This is in striking contrast to Argonaute proteins functioning directly in the miRNA pathway, ALG-1 and ALG-2: these proteins exclusively bind miRNAs. While playing no significant role in the biogenesis of the main pool of miRNAs, RDE-1 binds endogenous miRNAs and triggers RdRP activity on at least one perfectly matching, endogenous miRNA target. The resulting secondary siRNAs are taken up by a set of Argonaute proteins known to act as siRNA acceptors in exogenous RNAi, resulting in strong mRNA destabilization. Our results show that RDE-1 in an endogenous setting is actively screening the transcriptome using many different small RNAs, including miRNAs, as a guide, with implications for the evolution of transcripts with a potential to be recognized by Dicer.","Corrêa RL, Steiner FA, Berezikov E, Ketting RF."]],["SRP002317","no study abstract","Summary: C.elegans small RNAs from HA::ALG-1, HA::ALG-2 and HA::RDE-1 IP and rde-1 mutants\nOverall Design: Small RNAs were cloned from transgenic or mutant C. elegans adults.

We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions.

lines.","PLoS One","2010","SRA012517","Several recent studies have indicated that transcription is pervasive in regions outside of protein coding genes and that short antisense transcripts can originate from the promoter and terminator regions of genes. Here we investigate transcription of fragments longer than 200 nucleotides, focusing on antisense transcription for known protein coding genes and intergenic transcription. We find that roughly 12% to 16% of all reads that originate from promoter and terminator regions, respectively, map antisense to the gene in question. Furthermore, we detect a high number of novel transcriptionally active regions (TARs) that are generally expressed at a lower level than protein coding genes. We find that the correlation between RNA-seq data and microarray data is dependent on the gene length, with longer genes showing a better correlation. We detect high antisense transcriptional activity from promoter, terminator and intron regions of protein-coding genes and identify a vast number of previously unidentified TARs, including putative novel EGFR transcripts. This shows that in-depth analysis of the transcriptome using RNA-seq is a valuable tool for understanding complex transcriptional events. Furthermore, the development of new algorithms for estimation of gene expression from RNA-seq data is necessary to minimize length bias.","Klevebring D, Bjursell M, Emanuelsson O, Lundeberg J."]],["SRP002338","We sequenced the transcriptome of three human cell lines used in the Human Protein Atlas program (http://www.proteinatlas.org).","no study description"],[["SRX019403","no description for experiment design","10 ug of total RNA was ribo-depleted using RiboMinus (Invitrogen) and used as input for the SOLiD Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit Rev C.","AB SOLiD System 3.0","Color Space","SRS059669",[["SRR040290","14,372,246","718,612,300","50"]]],["SRX019489","no description for experiment design","10 ug of total RNA was ribo-depleted using RiboMinus (Invitrogen) and used as input for the SOLiD Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit Rev C.","AB SOLiD System 3.0","Color Space","SRS059670",[["SRR040293","10,547,681","527,384,050","50"]]],["SRX019490","no description for experiment design","10 ug of total RNA was ribo-depleted using RiboMinus (Invitrogen) and used as input for the SOLiD Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit Rev C.","AB SOLiD System 3.0","Color Space","SRS059671",[["SRR040361","11,449,673","572,483,650","50"]]]],[["SRS059669","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS059670","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS059671","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA010763",[["20360389","mRNA deep sequencing reveals 75 new genes and a complex transcriptional landscape in Mimivirus.","Genome Res","2010-May","SRA010763","Mimivirus, a virus infecting Acanthamoeba, is the prototype of the Mimiviridae, the latest addition to the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses. The Mimivirus genome encodes close to 1000 proteins, many of them never before encountered in a virus, such as four amino-acyl tRNA synthetases. To explore the physiology of this exceptional virus and identify the genes involved in the building of its characteristic intracytoplasmic \"virion factory,\" we coupled electron microscopy observations with the massively parallel pyrosequencing of the polyadenylated RNA fractions of Acanthamoeba castellanii cells at various time post-infection. We generated 633,346 reads, of which 322,904 correspond to Mimivirus transcripts. This first application of deep mRNA sequencing (454 Life Sciences [Roche] FLX) to a large DNA virus allowed the precise delineation of the 5' and 3' extremities of Mimivirus mRNAs and revealed 75 new transcripts including several noncoding RNAs. Mimivirus genes are expressed across a wide dynamic range, in a finely regulated manner broadly described by three main temporal classes: early, intermediate, and late. This RNA-seq study confirmed the AAAATTGA sequence as an early promoter element, as well as the presence of palindromes at most of the polyadenylation sites. It also revealed a new promoter element correlating with late gene expression, which is also prominent in Sputnik, the recently described Mimivirus \"virophage.\" These results-validated genome-wide by the hybridization of total RNA extracted from infected Acanthamoeba cells on a tiling array (Agilent)--will constitute the foundation on which to build subsequent functional studies of the Mimivirus/Acanthamoeba system.","Legendre M, Audic S, Poirot O, Hingamp P, Seltzer V, Byrne D, Lartigue A, Lescot M, Bernadac A, Poulain J, Abergel C, Claverie JM."]],["SRP001690","Massively parallel pyrosequencing of polyadenylated RNA fractions of A. castellanii cells infected by mimivirus at various time during the infection.","Massively parallel pyrosequencing of RNA fractions of A. castellanii cells infected by mimivirus.

Briefly, cells were re-suspended in the provided buffer and disrupted by subsequent -80°C freezing and thawing in a water bath at 37°C for 5 minutes. Total RNA was eluted with approximately 200µL of DEPC treated water.","cDNA production (first strand): First-strand cDNA poly(A) synthesis was performed using the SuperScript III First-Strand kit (18080-051, Invitrogen). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the oligo(dT)20 primer provided by the kit in a reaction volume of 20 μL. A control reaction was also performed without the Superscript reverse transcriptase enzyme to monitor genomic contaminations.  cDNA production (second strand):Full-length cDNA synthesis: First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with the PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (Clontech Laboratries) using the SMART (Switching Mechanism at 5′ end of RNA Transcript) PCR technology (Clontech Laboratories), but following a modified protocol suggested by Roche Diagnostics to optimize sequencing using the 454 FLX Sequencing technology. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a modified CDS III oligo(dT) (Invitrogen Life Technologies): 5′-TAGAGACCGAGGCGGCCGACATGTTTTGTTTTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTTTN-3′ (N corresponds to the mix of A, G, or C). At the 5′-terminus of the template, a poly(C) tail is added to the cDNA using the terminal transferase activity of the reverse transcriptase. The SMART V oligonucleotide provided with the kit hybridizes to the poly(C) tail to form an RNA/DNA hybrid: 5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG-3′. Full-length LD PCR (long distance polymerase chain reaction):For the LD PCR reaction, we used the Advantage 2 PCR Kit (Clontech Laboratries). Only sscDNAs that have the 5′-SMART anchor can be used as a template for the LD PCR reaction, thus ruling out eventual genomic DNA contamination. For each time course (30 min, 3 h, 6 h, and 9 h), we performed 5 × 100 μL PCR reactions. To each 100-μL mix, we added 2 μL of first-strand cDNA reaction, 10 μL of Advantage Buffer10×, 2 μL of 10 mM dNTP mix, 2 μL of 10 μM 5′-SMART PCR primer, 2 μL of 10 μM Modified CDSIII 3′-PCR Primer, 2 μL of Advantage Polymerase mix 50×. The reaction volume was completed with 80 μL of RNase/DNase-free H2O. PCR were performed as follows: 1 min at 95°C (20 sec at 95°C, 6 min at 68°C) for 23 cycles. The optimal number of cycles was determined previously as 23 cycles by comparing different numbers of cycles, that is, 20, 23, 26, and 29 cycles. To assess the quality of the dscDNA sample, we loaded 5 μL of each sample onto a 1.1% agarose gel, resulting in a smear from 100 bp to 3.5 kb. The dscDNA was cleaned and concentrated using the PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Samples were eluted with 40 μL of H2O. cDNA purity was measured using the 260/280 nM ratio against 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5). LD PCR primers:5′-SMART V PCR: 5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3′; Modified CDSIII 3′PCR (N corresponds to the mixture of A, C or G): 5′-TAGAGGCCGAGGCGGCCGACATGTTTTGTCTTTTGTTCTGTTTCTTTTN-3′.","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS009766",[["SRR033843","76,310","21,519,389","281"]]]],[["SRS009765","cDNAs were synthesized using a Clontech SMART protocol optimized for 454 GS FLX sequencing from the polyadenylated RNA fraction of Acanthamoeba castellanii cells at T = 0, 3h, 6h and 9h following their infection by Mimivirus.",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS009766","cDNAs were synthesized using a Clontech SMART protocol optimized for 454 GS FLX sequencing from the polyadenylated RNA fraction of Acanthamoeba castellanii cells at T = -15mn, 1h30, 6h and 9h following their infection by Mimivirus.",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA012315",[["20300190","Characterization of the Melanoma miRNAome by Deep Sequencing.","PLoS One","2010","SRA012315","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18-23 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence specific manner.

We applied this pipeline to the analysis of CHO cells which were chosen as a model system owing to its relevance in the production of therapeutic proteins. Specifically, we analysed CHO cells undergoing butyrate treatment which is known to affect cell cycle regulation and to increase the specific productivity of recombinant proteins. By this means, we identified sequences for >13,000 CHO genes which added sequence information of approximately 5000 novel genes to the CHO model. More than 6000 transcript sequences are predicted to be complete, as they covered >95% of the corresponding mouse orthologs. Detailed analysis of selected biological functions such as DNA replication and cell cycle control, demonstrated the potential of NGS expression profiling in organisms without extended genome sequence to improve both data quantity and quality.","Birzele F, Schaub J, Rust W, Clemens C, Baum P, Kaufmann H, Weith A, Schulz TW, Hildebrandt T."]],["SRP001851","In this study the transcriptome of a chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line has been sequenced using the Illumina mRNAseq protocol.

The sequencing of transcripts (RNA-Seq) should offer several advantages over microarray-based methods, including the ability to detect somatic mutations and accurately measure allele-specific expression. To investigate these advantages we have applied a novel, strand-specific RNA-Seq method to tumors and matched normal tissue from three patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas. Additionally, to better understand the genomic determinants of the gene expression changes observed, we have sequenced the tumor and normal genomes of one of these patients. We demonstrate here that our RNA-Seq method accurately measures allelic imbalance and that measurement on the genome-wide scale yields novel insights into cancer etiology. As expected, the set of genes differentially expressed in the tumors is enriched for cell adhesion and differentiation functions, but, unexpectedly, the set of allelically imbalanced genes is also enriched for these same cancer-related functions. By comparing the transcriptomic perturbations observed in one patient to his underlying normal and tumor genomes, we find that allelic imbalance in the tumor is associated with copy number mutations and that copy number mutations are, in turn, strongly associated with changes in transcript abundance. These results support a model in which allele-specific deletions and duplications drive allele-specific changes in gene expression in the developing tumor.","Tuch BB, Laborde RR, Xu X, Gu J, Chung CB, Monighetti CK, Stanley SJ, Olsen KD, Kasperbauer JL, Moore EJ, Broomer AJ, Tan R, Brzoska PM, Muller MW, Siddiqui AS, Asmann YW, Sun Y, Kuersten S, Barker MA, De La Vega FM, Smith DI."]],["SRP002009","no study abstract","Summary: RNA-Seq was applied to oral squamous cell carcinomas and matched normal oral tissue to measure gene expression patterns and identify examples of allelic imbalance.\nOverall Design: Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) and matched normal tissue from 3 patients."],[["SRX017073","no description for experiment design","SOLiD whole transcriptome (WT) protocol with total RNA extracted using Qiagen RNAeasy Mini Kit.

We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE.

Massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been revolutionizing global transcriptomic analysis. Here, using a novel differential approach (dRNA-seq) selective for the 5’ end of primary transcripts, we present a genome-wide map of H. pylori transcriptional start sites (TSS) and operons. We discovered hundreds of TSS within operons, and opposite to annotated genes, suggesting that complexity of gene expression from the small H. pylori genome is increased by uncoupling of polycistrons and by genome-wide antisense transcription. We also discovered an unexpected number of ~60 small RNAs including the ε-subdivision counterpart of the regulatory 6S RNA and associated pRNAs, and potential regulators of cis- and trans-encoded target mRNAs. Our approach establishes a paradigm for mapping and annotating the primary transcriptomes of many living species.    Authors:    Cynthia M.

free-living amoebozoan protist displaying a complex life cycle, including alternation between single- and multinucleate stages through sporulation, a simple form of cell differentiation. Sporulation in Physarum can be experimentally induced by several external factors, and Physarum displays many biochemical features typical for metazoan cells, including metazoan-type signaling pathways, which makes this organism a model to study cell cycle, cell differentiation and cellular reprogramming.In order to identify the genes associated to the light-induced sporulation in Physarum, especially those related to signal transduction, we isolated RNA before and after photoinduction from sporulation- competent cells, and used these RNAs to synthesize cDNAs, which were then analyzed using the 454 sequencing technology. We obtained 16,669 cDNAs that were annotated at every computational level. 13,169 transcripts included hit count data, from which 2,772 displayed significant differential expression (upregulated: 1,623; downregulated: 1,149). Transcripts with valid annotations and significant differential expression were later integrated into putative networks using interaction information from orthologs.Gene ontology analysis suggested that most significantly downregulated genes are linked to DNA repair, cell division, inhibition of cell migration, and calcium release, while highly upregulated genes were involved in cell death, cell polarization, maintenance of integrity, and differentiation. In addition, cell death- associated transcripts were overrepresented between the upregulated transcripts. These changes are associated to a network of actin-binding proteins encoded by genes that are differentially regulated before and after light induction.","Barrantes I, Glockner G, Meyer S, Marwan W."]],["SRP001397","Physarum polycephalum cells were starved for 6 hours.

The main limitation of this approach is that examples from both classes are required which might be infeasible in certain cases, especially those dealing with biological data. Such is the case for membrane-binding peripheral domains that play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking by reversibly binding to membranes. For these domains, a well-defined positive set is available with domains known to bind membrane along with a large unlabeled set of domains whose membrane binding affinities have not been measured. The aforementioned limitation can be addressed by a special class of semi-supervised machine learning called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning that uses a positive set with a large unlabeled set. METHODS In this study, we implement the first application of PU-learning to a protein function prediction problem: identification of peripheral domains. PU-learning starts by identifying reliable negative (RN) examples iteratively from the unlabeled set until convergence and builds a classifier using the positive and the final RN set. A data set of 232 positive cases and ~3750 unlabeled ones were used to construct and validate the protocol.Holdout evaluation of the protocol on a left-out positive set showed that the accuracy of prediction reached up to 95% during two independent implementations.These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains.

The main limitation of this approach is that examples from both classes are required which might be infeasible in certain cases, especially those dealing with biological data. Such is the case for membrane-binding peripheral domains that play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking by reversibly binding to membranes. For these domains, a well-defined positive set is available with domains known to bind membrane along with a large unlabeled set of domains whose membrane binding affinities have not been measured. The aforementioned limitation can be addressed by a special class of semi-supervised machine learning called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning that uses a positive set with a large unlabeled set. METHODS In this study, we implement the first application of PU-learning to a protein function prediction problem: identification of peripheral domains. PU-learning starts by identifying reliable negative (RN) examples iteratively from the unlabeled set until convergence and builds a classifier using the positive and the final RN set. A data set of 232 positive cases and ~3750 unlabeled ones were used to construct and validate the protocol.Holdout evaluation of the protocol on a left-out positive set showed that the accuracy of prediction reached up to 95% during two independent implementations.These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains. Protocols like the one presented here become particularly useful in the case of availability of information from one class only.","Bhardwaj N, Gerstein M, Lu H."],["18423832","Highly integrated single-base resolution maps of the epigenome in Arabidopsis.","Cell","2008-May-2","SRA000286","Deciphering the multiple layers of epigenetic regulation that control transcription is critical to understanding how plants develop and respond to their environment.

At single-base resolution we discovered extensive, previously undetected DNA methylation, identified the context and level of methylation at each site, and observed local sequence effects upon methylation state. Deep sequencing of smRNAs revealed a direct relationship between the location of smRNAs and DNA methylation, perturbation of smRNA biogenesis upon loss of CpG DNA methylation, and a tendency for smRNAs to direct strand-specific DNA methylation in regions of RNA-DNA homology. Finally, strand-specific mRNA-seq revealed altered transcript abundance of hundreds of genes, transposons, and unannotated intergenic transcripts upon modification of the DNA methylation state.","Lister R, O'Malley RC, Tonti-Filippini J, Gregory BD, Berry CC, Millar AH, Ecker JR."]],["SRP000568","no study abstract","Transcriptome sequencing of wildtype Arabidopsis plants (Col-0), and met1, drm1 drm2 cmt3, and ros1 dml2 dml3 null mutants using the Illumina Genetic Analyzer."],[["SRX002554","no description for experiment design","RNA-seq library construction protocol: Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with DNaseI (Qiagen) for 30 min at room temperature. following ethanol precipitation the 18S and 28S rRNA molecules were depleted from 20 �g of total RNA in three sequential Ribominus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) reactions as per manufacturer's instructions, using 6 plant-specific biotinylated LNA oligonucleotide rRNA probes supplied by (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

In fission yeast, RNAi is tightly coupled to template transcription and chromatin modifications that establish heterochromatin in cis. Exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers seem to induce heterochromatin formation in trans only when certain silencing proteins are overexpressed. Here, we show that green fluorescent protein (GFP) hairpin dsRNA allows production of high levels of Argonaute-associated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which can induce heterochromatin formation at a remote locus. This silencing does not require any manipulation apart from hairpin expression. In cells expressing a ura4(+)-GFP fusion gene, production of GFP siRNAs causes the appearance of ura4 siRNAs from the target gene. Production of these secondary siRNAs depends on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Rdp1 (RDRP(Rdp1)) function and other RNAi pathway components. This demonstrates that transitivity occurs in fission yeast and implies that RDRP(Rdp1) can synthesize RNA from targeted RNA templates in vivo, generating siRNAs not homologous to the hairpin.","Simmer F, Buscaino A, Kos-Braun IC, Kagansky A, Boukaba A, Urano T, Kerr AR, Allshire RC."]],["SRP001896","no study abstract","Summary: We provide evidence of the generation of Rdp1-mediated secondary siRNAs in vivo in fission yeast.

Despite being rich data sources, they have not been used much due to the difficulty in locating and analyzing datasets of interest.Geoseq http://geoseq.mssm.edu provides a new method of analyzing short reads from deep sequencing experiments. Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. It is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. The analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs. The ease of using Geoseq for these analyses suggests its utility and uniqueness as an analysis tool.","Gurtowski J, Cancio A, Shah H, Levovitz C, George A, Homann R, Sachidanandam R."],["20059948","The TDRD9-MIWI2 complex is essential for piRNA-mediated retrotransposon silencing in the mouse male germline.","Dev Cell","2009-Dec","SRA010798","Host-defense mechanisms against transposable elements are critical to protect the genome information. Here we show that tudor-domain containing 9 (Tdrd9) is essential for silencing Line-1 retrotransposon in the mouse male germline. Tdrd9 encodes an ATPase/DExH-type helicase, and its mutation causes male sterility showing meiotic failure. In Tdrd9 mutants, Line-1 was highly activated and piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) corresponding to Line-1 were increased, suggesting that feedforward amplification operates in the mutant. In fetal testes, Tdrd9 mutation causes Line-1 desilencing and an aberrant piRNA profile in prospermatogonia, followed by cognate DNA demethylation. TDRD9 complexes with MIWI2 with distinct compartmentalization in processing bodies, and this TDRD9-MIWI2 localization is regulated by MILI and TDRD1 residing at intermitochondrial cement. Our results identify TDRD9 as a functional partner of MIWI2 and indicate that the tudor-piwi association is a conserved feature, while two separate axes, TDRD9-MIWI2 and TDRD1-MILI, cooperate nonredundantly in the piwi-small RNA pathway in the mouse male germline.2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here we report the first large expressed sequence tag (EST) study of a candidate for ecological sympatric speciation, the apple maggot Rhagoletis pomonella, using massively parallel pyrosequencing on the Roche 454-FLX platform. To maximize transcript diversity we created and sequenced separate libraries from larvae, pupae, adult heads, and headless adult bodies.We obtained 239,531 sequences which assembled into 24,373 contigs. A total of 6810 unique protein coding genes were identified among the contigs and long singletons, corresponding to 48% of all known Drosophila melanogaster protein-coding genes. Their distribution across GO classes suggests that we have obtained a representative sample of the transcriptome. Among these sequences are many candidates for potential R. pomonella \"speciation genes\" (or \"barrier genes\") such as those controlling chemosensory and life-history timing processes. Furthermore, we identified important marker loci including more than 40,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and over 100 microsatellites. An initial search for SNPs at which the apple and hawthorn host races differ suggested at least 75 loci warranting further work. We also determined that developmental expression differences remained even after normalization; transcripts expected to show different expression levels between larvae and pupae in D. melanogaster also did so in R. pomonella. Preliminary comparative analysis of transcript presences and absences revealed evidence of gene loss in Drosophila and gain in the higher dipteran clade Schizophora.These data provide a much needed resource for exploring mechanisms of divergence in this important model for sympatric ecological speciation. Our description of ESTs from a substantial portion of the R. pomonella transcriptome will facilitate future functional studies of candidate genes for olfaction and diapause-related life history timing, and will enable large scale expression studies. Similarly, the identification of new SNP and microsatellite markers will facilitate future population and quantitative genetic studies of divergence between the apple and hawthorn-infesting host races.","Schwarz D, Robertson HM, Feder JL, Varala K, Hudson ME, Ragland GJ, Hahn DA, Berlocher SH."]],["SRP000268","no study abstract","no study description"],[["SRX001121","no description for experiment design","cDNAs samples were synthesized with the following adaptors:  (5%u2019SMART original)  5'- AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG - 3'  (CDS-first)         5'-  TAGAGACCGAGGCGGCCGACATGTTTTGTTTTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTTT  -3'","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS000871",[["SRR005649","44,827","11,690,321","260"],["SRR006574","8,974","1,095,863","122"],["SRR006575","20,843","5,679,744","272"]]],["SRX001529","no description for experiment design","cDNAs samples were synthesized with the following adaptors:  (5%u2019SMART original)  5'- AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG - 3'  (CDS-first)         5'-  TAGAGACCGAGGCGGCCGACATGTTTTGTTTTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTTT  -3'","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS001170",[["SRR005651","30,721","7,643,515","248"],["SRR006572","6,901","857,365","124"],["SRR006573","24,867","6,549,892","263"]]],["SRX001530","no description for experiment design","cDNAs samples were synthesized with the following adaptors:  (5%u2019SMART original)  5'- AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG - 3'  (CDS-first)         5'-  TAGAGACCGAGGCGGCCGACATGTTTTGTTTTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTTT  -3'","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS001171",[["SRR005652","66,275","18,616,878","280"],["SRR005653","54,976","14,934,172","271"]]],["SRX001531","no description for experiment design","cDNAs samples were synthesized with the following adaptors:  (5%u2019SMART original)  5'- AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG - 3'  (CDS-first)         5'-  TAGAGACCGAGGCGGCCGACATGTTTTGTTTTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTTT  -3'","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS001172",[["SRR005655","44,717","11,705,810","261"],["SRR006570","7,240","878,555","121"],["SRR006571","35,908","9,802,138","272"]]],["SRX001885","no description for experiment design","cDNAs samples were synthesized with the following adaptors:  (5%u2019-SMART-TT) 5' -AAG CAG TGG TAT CAA CGC AGA GTG GCC ATT ACG GCC TTG GG-3' (CDS second)  5'- TAG AGG CCG AGG CGG CCG ACA TGT TTT GTC TTT TGT TCT GTT TCT TTT -3'","454 GS FLX","Base Space","SRS001172",[["SRR006566","68,522","18,768,045","273"]]]],[["SRS000871","We sampled a variety of different life stages of Rhagoletis pomonella ranging from larvae to adults.

Plants produce bioactive natural products for defense, but some insects detoxify and/or sequester the compounds, opening up for new niches with fewer competitors. To study the molecular mechanism behind the co-adaption in plant-insect interactions, we have investigated the interactions between Lotus corniculatus and Zygaena filipendulae. They both contain cyanogenic glucosides which liberate toxic hydrogen cyanide upon breakdown. Moths belonging to the Zygaena family are the only insects known, able to carry out both de novo biosynthesis and sequestration of the same cyanogenic glucosides as those from their feed plants. The biosynthetic pathway for cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis in Z. filipendulae proceeds using the same intermediates as in the well known pathway from plants, but none of the enzymes responsible have been identified. A genomics strategy founded on 454 pyrosequencing of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome was undertaken to identify some of these enzymes in Z. filipendulae.Comparisons of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome with the sequenced genomes of Bombyx mori, Drosophila melanogaster, Tribolium castaneum, Apis mellifera and Anopheles gambiae indicate a high coverage of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome. 11% of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome sequences were assigned to Gene Ontology categories. Candidate genes for enzymes functioning in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides (cytochrome P450 and family 1 glycosyltransferases) were identified based on sequence length, number of copies and presence/absence of close homologs in D. melanogaster, B. mori and the cyanogenic butterfly Heliconius. Examination of biased codon usage, GC content and selection on gene candidates support the notion of cyanogenesis as an \"old\" trait within Ditrysia, as well as its origins being convergent between plants and insects.Pyrosequencing is an attractive approach to gain access to genes in the biosynthesis of bio-active natural products from insects and other organisms, for which the genome sequence is not known. Based on analysis of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome, promising gene candidates for biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides was identified, and the suitability of Z. filipendulae as a model system for cyanogenesis in insects is evident.","Zagrobelny M, Scheibye-Alsing K, Jensen NB, Møller BL, Gorodkin J, Bak S."]],["SRP001113","Linamarin and lotaustralin are aliphatic cyanogenic glucosides widespread in plants and also found in many insects. Moths belonging to the Zygaena family are the only known insects able to carry out de novo biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucosides and to sequester them from their food plants as well. Upon cleavage by beta-glucosidases, cyanogenic glucosides release hydrogen cyanide and thereby provide protection against predators. Female Z. filipendulae moths also prefer males with a high content of cyanogenic glucosides and the chosen male transfer cyanogenic glucosides to her during mating. The biosynthetic pathway for cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis in the Z. filipendulae moth proceeds using the same intermediates as in plants, but none of the genes or enzymes responsible have been identified in the moth. A genomics strategy founded on 454 pyrosequencing of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome was undertaken to identify some of these genes in Z. filipendulae. Comparisons of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome with the sequenced genomes of Bombyx mori and Drosophila melanogaster indicate a high coverage of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome. The Z. filipendulae transcriptome was also compared to known sequences from cyanogenic Heliconius butterflies. This work demonstrated that pyrosequencing is an attractive approach to gain access to genes in the biosynthesis of bio-active natural products from e.g. insects for which the genome sequence is not known.

Despite the importance of this tissue in plant fitness, virtually no study has addressed the basic aspects of sepal development and functioning. Because of its large size and its impressive metabolic activity (both in terms of quantity and diversity of secondary metabolites), we have used clary sage calyx as a model system to generate the first high throughput sequencing of the transcriptome of an angiosperm calyx. We applied massive parallel 454 pyrosequencing technology to a normalized cDNA extract and unveiled potential candidate genes for all steps of secondary metabolite pathways (phenylpropanoids and terpenoids). It also proved efficient in predicting the expression of large numbers of transcription factors and, with the use of bioinformatics tools, it predicted in the same sequencing run the presence of a novel class of gene transcription regulatory elements, miRNAs, without the need to generate a separate miRNA library. In our clary sage EST library, 18 conserved miRNAs were predicted. Among them, 15 were present in most studied plant species while the others were only shared with limited or discrete plant lineages. A separate data mining of the same clary sage EST library suggested the presence of 19 potential target genes to the 18 predicted conserved miRNAs. These coded for only 6 transcription factors or F-box proteins, 11 metabolism or abiotic stress response related proteins and 2 products with no known predicted function.

After a single gel-extraction step to size select a 350 bp library, the adapter ligated library was amplified with 12 cycles of PCR. 1µg of either genomic DNA or RNA (cDNA) paired end Genome Analyzer library was added to 100 µg of Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, UK) with 1 µl each of the paired-end enhancing oligos (1 mM). The libraries were then hybridized to the sequence capture array for 72 hours at 42°C according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Arrays were stringently washed at 47.5ºC, and hybridized DNA eluted with NaOH. At multiple stages of the protocol, DNA size ranges were checked by Agilent Bioanalyzer and concentration by OD260/280 (Nanodrop, USA). Hybridization and elution of libraries was undertaken by Roche Nimblegen in Madison, USA.\n\n        ","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS006135",[["SRR027894","10,147,832","1,542,470,464","152"],["SRR027895","10,100,770","1,535,317,040","152"]]],["SRX011552","not provided","\n          A standard Illumina gDNA library was constructed with fragmentation via sonication\n        ","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS006136",[["SRR027892","4,416,344","671,284,288","152"],["SRR027893","4,942,217","751,216,984","152"]]],["SRX011553","not provided","\n          not provided\n        ","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS006134",[["SRR027874","4,862,281","218,802,645","45"]]],["SRX011554","not provided","\n          not provided\n        ","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS005033",[["SRR027881","6,945,265","305,591,660","44"]]],["SRX011555","not provided","\n          not provided\n        ","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS005035",[["SRR027887","7,642,749","336,280,956","44"]]],["SRX011556","not provided","\n          not provided\n        ","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS005031",[["SRR027868","8,272,566","372,265,470","45"],["SRR027869","7,585,680","333,769,920","44"],["SRR027873","5,425,533","244,148,985","45"]]],["SRX011557","not provided","\n          not provided\n        ","Illumina Genome Analyzer","Base Space","SRS005034",[["SRR027886","7,671,071","337,527,124","44"]]]],[["SRS005029","CD4 T cell Transcriptome Activated for 3 hours with CD3 Cd28 antibodies",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS005030","CD4 T cell Transcriptome Resting",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS005031","CD4 T cell Transcriptome Activated for 3 hours with CD3 Cd28 antibodies",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS005032","CD4 T cell Transcriptome Activated for 3 hours with CD3 Cd28 antibodies",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS005033","CD4 T cell Transcriptome Resting",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS005034","CD4 T cell Transcriptome Activated for 3 hours with CD3 Cd28 antibodies",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS005035","CD4 T cell Transcriptome Resting",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS006134","CD4 T cell Transcriptome Resting",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS006135","CD4 T cell Transcriptome Activated for 3 hours with CD3 Cd28 antibodies",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS006136","CD4 gDNA Library from Whole Blood",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA010013",[["19812547","A regulatory circuit for piwi by the large Maf gene traffic jam in Drosophila.","Nature","2009-Oct-29","SRA010013","PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence retrotransposons in Drosophila germ lines by associating with the PIWI proteins Argonaute 3 (AGO3), Aubergine (Aub) and Piwi. piRNAs in Drosophila are produced from intergenic repetitive genes and piRNA clusters by two systems: the primary processing pathway and the amplification loop. The amplification loop occurs in a Dicer-independent, PIWI-Slicer-dependent manner. However, primary piRNA processing remains elusive. Here we analysed piRNA processing in a Drosophila ovarian somatic cell line where Piwi, but not Aub or AGO3, is expressed; thus, only the primary piRNAs exist. In addition to flamenco, a Piwi-specific piRNA cluster, traffic jam (tj), a large Maf gene, was determined as a new piRNA cluster. piRNAs arising from tj correspond to the untranslated regions of tj messenger RNA and are sense-oriented. piRNA loading on to Piwi may occur in the cytoplasm. zucchini, a gene encoding a putative cytoplasmic nuclease, is required for tj-derived piRNA production. In tj and piwi mutant ovaries, somatic cells fail to intermingle with germ cells and Fasciclin III is overexpressed. Loss of tj abolishes Piwi expression in gonadal somatic cells. Thus, in gonadal somatic cells, tj gives rise simultaneously to two different molecules: the TJ protein, which activates Piwi expression, and piRNAs, which define the Piwi targets for silencing.","Saito K, Inagaki S, Mituyama T, Kawamura Y, Ono Y, Sakota E, Kotani H, Asai K, Siomi H, Siomi MC."]],["SRP001366","no study abstract","Summary: piRNAs function in silencing retrotransposons by associating with the PIWI proteins, AGO3, Aub, and Piwi, in Drosophila germlines.

Both genome-scale tiling arrays and massively parallel sequencing now allow transcriptomes to be mapped at unprecedented depth. We used both technologies to map the C. elegans transcriptome across development. This unbiased overview can serve as a framework for assessing transcriptome changes in a mutant animal and we compared the wild-type data with that of animals that have lost the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway.   Results  We find that while the great majority of detectable transcripts map to known gene structures, over 5% of transcribed regions are novel, falling outside current gene annotations. We show that at least 40% of these are novel exons.  We also used both technologies to assess isoform complexity and estimate that at least 17% of genes change their major isoform across development. Having mapped the wild-type transcriptome, we examined how this is perturbed in animals lacking nonsense –mediated decay (NMD). NMD prevents expression of prematurely truncated proteins by degrading transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs). We find that ~20% of all genes produce transcripts that appear to be targets for NMD.  While most of these arise from splicing errors, NMD targets are also enriched for transcripts that contain short open reading frames upstream of the predicted translational start (uORFs).  We find an intriguing relationship between the strength of Kozak consensus surrounding the true start codon and the degree to which these uORF containing transcripts are targeted by NMD, suggesting that translational efficiency may be coupled to transcript turnover via the NMD pathway for many transcripts.  Conclusions  We have generated a high-resolution map of the C. elegans transcriptome and have used it to identify transcripts that are endogenous targets of the NMD machinery.

Most of this broad body of knowledge was obtained indirectly because current transcriptome analysis methods typically require RNA to be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) before measurements, even though the cDNA synthesis step introduces multiple biases and artefacts that interfere with both the proper characterization and quantification of transcripts.

The family of ADAR enzymes converts some adenosines of RNA duplexes to inosines through hydrolytic deamination. The adenosine recognition mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, to investigate it, we analyzed a set of selectively edited substrates with a cluster of edited sites. We used a large set of individual transcripts sequenced by the 454 sequencing technique. On average, we analyzed 570 single transcripts per edited region at four different developmental stages from embryogenesis to adulthood. To our knowledge, this is the first time, large-scale sequencing has been used to determine synchronous editing events. We demonstrate that edited sites are only coupled within specific distances from each other. Furthermore, our results show that the coupled sites of editing are positioned on the same side of a helix, indicating that the three-dimensional structure is key in ADAR enzyme substrate recognition.

Using the 454 sequencing technology we are able to determine even low levels of editing with high accuracy. The efficiency of editing for 28 different sites where analyzed during the development of the mouse brain from embryogenesis to adulthood. We show that with few exceptions the editing efficiency is low during embryogenesis, increasing gradually at different rates up to the adult mouse. The variation in editing give receptors like the Htr2c and the GABAA a different set of protein isoforms during the development than in the adult animal.

We compared simulation results for traditional capillary sequencing with \"Next Generation\" (NG) ultra high-throughput technologies. The simulation model was parameterized using mappings of 130,000 cDNA sequence reads to the Arabidopsis genome (NCBI Accession SRA008180.19). We also generated 454-GS20 sequences and de novo assemblies for the basal eudicot California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) and the magnoliid avocado (Persea americana) using a variety of methods for cDNA synthesis.The Arabidopsis reads tagged more than 15,000 genes, including new splice variants and extended UTR regions. Of the total 134,791 reads (13.8 MB), 119,518 (88.7%) mapped exactly to known exons, while 1,117 (0.8%) mapped to introns, 11,524 (8.6%) spanned annotated intron/exon boundaries, and 3,066 (2.3%) extended beyond the end of annotated UTRs. Sequence-based inference of relative gene expression levels correlated significantly with microarray data. As expected, NG sequencing of normalized libraries tagged more genes than non-normalized libraries, although non-normalized libraries yielded more full-length cDNA sequences. The Arabidopsis data were used to simulate additional rounds of NG and traditional EST sequencing, and various combinations of each. Our simulations suggest a combination of FLX and Solexa sequencing for optimal transcriptome coverage at modest cost. We have also developed ESTcalc http://fgp.huck.psu.edu/NG_Sims/ngsim.pl, an online webtool, which allows users to explore the results of this study by specifying individualized costs and sequencing characteristics.NG sequencing technologies are a highly flexible set of platforms that can be scaled to suit different project goals. In terms of sequence coverage alone, the NG sequencing is a dramatic advance over capillary-based sequencing, but NG sequencing also presents significant challenges in assembly and sequence accuracy due to short read lengths, method-specific sequencing errors, and the absence of physical clones. These problems may be overcome by hybrid sequencing strategies using a mixture of sequencing methodologies, by new assemblers, and by sequencing more deeply. Sequencing and microarray outcomes from multiple experiments suggest that our simulator will be useful for guiding NG transcriptome sequencing projects in a wide range of organisms.","Wall PK, Leebens-Mack J, Chanderbali AS, Barakat A, Wolcott E, Liang H, Landherr L, Tomsho LP, Hu Y, Carlson JE, Ma H, Schuster SC, Soltis DE, Soltis PS, Altman N, dePamphilis CW."]],["SRP000615","no study abstract","no study description"],[["SRX002936","no description for experiment design","no description for library construction","454 GS 20","Base Space","SRS002186",[["SRR014005","134,791","15,542,292","115"]]],["SRX002986","no description for experiment design","no description for library construction","454 GS 20","Base Space","SRS002202",[["SRR014399","170,486","19,836,781","116"],["SRR014400","134,452","15,646,892","116"],["SRR014414","510","58,499","114"],["SRR014415","1,723","198,907","115"],["SRR014416","3,679","423,620","115"],["SRR014417","6,559","765,446","116"]]],["SRX002987","no description for experiment design","no description for library construction","454 GS 20","Base Space","SRS002203",[["SRR014116","137,377","15,689,115","114"],["SRR014117","126,828","14,602,382","115"]]],["SRX002988","no description for experiment design","no description for library construction","454 GS 20","Base Space","SRS002203",[["SRR014118","140,901","15,962,545","113"],["SRR014119","171,016","19,499,884","114"]]]],[["SRS002186","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS002202","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]],["SRS002203","no sample description",[["no attribution tag","no attribution value"]]]]],["SRA007807",[["19646242","Characterization of the Zoarces viviparus liver transcriptome using massively parallel pyrosequencing.","BMC Genomics","2009","SRA007807","The teleost Zoarces viviparus (eelpout) lives along the coasts of Northern Europe and has long been an established model organism for marine ecology and environmental monitoring.

This approach could be very valuable for complex plant genomes. In addition, little emphasis has been given to efforts aiming at an estimation of the overall transcriptional universe found in a multicellular organism at a specific developmental stage.To explore, in depth, the transcriptional diversity in an ancient maize landrace, we developed a protocol to optimize the sequencing of cDNAs and performed 4 consecutive GS20-454 pyrosequencing runs of a cDNA library obtained from 2 week-old Palomero Toluqueño maize plants. The protocol reported here allowed obtaining over 90% of informative sequences. These GS20-454 runs generated over 1.5 Million reads, representing the largest amount of sequences reported from a single plant cDNA library. A collection of 367,391 quality-filtered reads (30.09 Mb) from a single run was sufficient to identify transcripts corresponding to 34% of public maize ESTs databases; total sequences generated after 4 filtered runs increased this coverage to 50%. Comparisons of all 1.5 Million reads to the Maize Assembled Genomic Islands (MAGIs) provided evidence for the transcriptional activity of 11% of MAGIs. We estimate that 5.67% (86,069 sequences) do not align with public ESTs or annotated genes, potentially representing new maize transcripts. Following the assembly of 74.4% of the reads in 65,493 contigs, real-time PCR of selected genes confirmed a predicted correlation between the abundance of GS20-454 sequences and corresponding levels of gene expression.A protocol was developed that significantly increases the number, length and quality of cDNA reads using massive 454 parallel sequencing. We show that recurrent 454 pyrosequencing of a single cDNA sample is necessary to attain a thorough representation of the transcriptional universe present in maize, that can also be used to estimate transcript abundance of specific genes. This data suggests that the molecular and functional diversity contained in the vast native landraces remains to be explored, and that large-scale transcriptional sequencing of a presumed ancestor of the modern maize varieties represents a valuable approach to characterize the functional diversity of maize for future agricultural and evolutionary studies.","Vega-Arreguín JC, Ibarra-Laclette E, Jiménez-Moraila B, Martínez O, Vielle-Calzada JP, Herrera-Estrella L, Herrera-Estrella A."]],["SRP000666","In-depth sequencing analysis has not been able to determine the overall complexity of transcriptional activity of a plant organ or tissue sample.

For example, there is an urgent need to understand the potential for corals to adapt to climate change, but few molecular resources are available for studying these processes in reef-building corals. To facilitate genomics studies in corals and other non-model systems, we describe methods for transcriptome sequencing using 454, as well as strategies for assembling a useful catalog of genes from the output. We have applied these methods to sequence the transcriptome of planulae larvae from the coral Acropora millepora.More than 600,000 reads produced in a single 454 sequencing run were assembled into approximately 40,000 contigs with five-fold average sequencing coverage. Based on sequence similarity with known proteins, these analyses identified approximately 11,000 different genes expressed in a range of conditions including thermal stress and settlement induction. Assembled sequences were annotated with gene names, conserved domains, and Gene Ontology terms. Targeted searches using these annotations identified the majority of genes associated with essential metabolic pathways and conserved signaling pathways, as well as novel candidate genes for stress-related processes. Comparisons with the genome of the anemone Nematostella vectensis revealed approximately 8,500 pairs of orthologs and approximately 100 candidate coral-specific genes. More than 30,000 SNPs were detected in the coral sequences, and a subset of these validated by re-sequencing.The methods described here for deep sequencing of the transcriptome should be widely applicable to generate catalogs of genes and genetic markers in emerging model organisms. Our data provide the most comprehensive sequence resource currently available for reef-building corals, and include an extensive collection of potential genetic markers for association and population connectivity studies.

This chestnut blight is caused by Cryphonectria parasitica, a fungus that infects stem tissues and kills the trees by girdling them. Because of the great economic and ecological value of this species, significant efforts have been made over the century to combat this disease, but it wasn't until recently that a focused genomics approach was initiated. Prior to the Genomic Tool Development for the Fagaceae project, genomic resources available in public databases for this species were limited to a few hundred ESTs. To identify genes involved in resistance to C. parasitica, we have sequenced the transcriptome from fungal infected and healthy stem tissues collected from blight-sensitive American chestnut and blight-resistant Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) trees using ultra high throughput pyrosequencing. RESULTS: We produced over a million 454 reads, totaling over 250 million bp, from which we generated 40,039 and 28,890 unigenes in total from C. mollissima and C. dentata respectively. The functions of the unigenes, from GO annotation, cover a diverse set of molecular functions and biological processes, among which we identified a large number of genes associated with resistance to stresses and response to biotic stimuli. In silico expression analyses showed that many of the stress response unigenes were expressed more in canker tissues versus healthy stem tissues in both American and Chinese chestnut. Comparative analysis also identified genes belonging to different pathways of plant defense against biotic stresses that are differentially expressed in either American or Chinese chestnut canker tissues. CONCLUSION: Our study resulted in the identification of a large set of cDNA unigenes from American chestnut and Chinese chestnut. The ESTs and unigenes from this study constitute an important resource to the scientific community interested in the discovery of genes involved in various biological processes in Chestnut and other species. The identification of many defense-related genes differentially expressed in canker vs. healthy stem in chestnuts provides many new candidate genes for developing resistance to the chestnut blight and for studying pathways involved in responses of trees to necrotrophic pathogens. We also identified several candidate genes that may underline the difference in resistance to Cryphonectria parasitica between American chestnut and Chinese chestnut.","Barakat A, DiLoreto DS, Zhang Y, Smith C, Baier K, Powell WA, Wheeler N, Sederoff R, Carlson JE."]],["SRP000395","The family of forest trees (the Fagaceae) that includes the chestnuts, oaks and beeches, dominates the hardwood forests of the northern hemisphere.

Each whole fish was homogenized in the presence of TRIzol® Reagent using a TissueLyzer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA from each fish was purified using TRIzol® Plus RNA Purification System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The mRNA was further purified using Oligotex mRNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Manufacture’s protocols were followed during these processes and the concentrations of the total RNA and the mRNA were determined using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.                  cDNA was synthesized using SuperScriptTM III  reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A quarter of the total mRNA purified from each fish was split into 8 cDNA synthesis reactions with both the primers for IgM and IgZ constant regions and SUPERase·InTM (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNase H (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA) was added to each reaction to remove RNA at the end of the cDNA synthesis step. All enzyme concentrations, reaction volumes and the incubation temperature were based on the manufacturer’s protocol for synthesis of cDNA from up to 500ng of mRNA using gene specific primers.                  Each cDNA synthesis reaction (20µl) was split into two PCR reactions, and a total of 16 PCR reactions were set up for each fish. Each of the 27 forward primers was added so that each V segment was represented by a final concentration of 200nM primer. Since some primers covered multiple V gene segments, their concentration was in proportion to the number of V segments. Both reverse primers were added at a concentration of 7.8mM. The PCR program began with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 minutes, followed by 28 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing of primer to DNA at 60°C for 30 s, and extension by Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen, Carlbad, CA) at 68°C for 2 minutes. PCR products were cleaned using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the concentration was measured using the nanodrop spectrophotometer.","About 2µg of QIAquick cleaned PCR product for each fish was used to start the 454 library preparation process. AMPure SPRI beads (Agencourt, Beverly, MA) were used to concentrate PCR product and remove the remaining primers. 454 FLX DNA library construction protocol was followed for all samples. Briefly, double stranded DNA was end polished and ligated to sequencing adaptors which contained a molecular identifier (MID, a nucleotide based barcode system). This allowed us to multiplex the sequencing plate and also served as an internal control. The rest of the Roche 454 protocol was followed which includes library immobilization, fill-in reaction and single stranded template DNA (sstDNA) library isolation. The sstDNA was quantified using a digital-PCR method developed in our lab (White et al. \"Digital PCR provides sensitive and absolute calibration for high throughput sequencing\" BMC Genomics, 2009), which gave the absolute count of DNA molecules in the library.

We report genomic landscapes of representative epigenetic modifications and their relationships to mRNA and small RNA (smRNA) transcriptomes in maize shoots and roots. The epigenetic patterns differed dramatically between genes and transposable elements, and two repressive marks (H3K27me3 and DNA methylation) were usually mutually exclusive. We found an organ-specific distribution of canonical microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), indicative of their tissue-specific biogenesis. Furthermore, we observed that a decreasing level of mop1 led to a concomitant decrease of 24-nucleotide siRNAs relative to 21-nucleotide miRNAs in a tissue-specific manner. A group of 22-nucleotide siRNAs may originate from long-hairpin double-stranded RNAs and preferentially target gene-coding regions. Additionally, a class of miRNA-like smRNAs, whose putative precursors can form short hairpins, potentially targets genes in trans.

Although crucial roles for 3'UTR-mediated gene regulation have been found in Caenorhabditis elegans, most C. elegans genes have lacked annotated 3'UTRs. Here we describe a high-throughput method for reliable identification of polyadenylated RNA termini, and we apply this method, called poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-Seq), to determine C. elegans 3'UTRs. Compared to standard methods also recently applied to C. elegans UTRs, 3P-Seq identified 8,580 additional UTRs while excluding thousands of shorter UTR isoforms that do not seem to be authentic. Analysis of this expanded and corrected data set suggested that the high A/U content of C. elegans 3'UTRs facilitated genome compaction, because the elements specifying cleavage and polyadenylation, which are A/U rich, can more readily emerge in A/U-rich regions. Indeed, 30% of the protein-coding genes have mRNAs with alternative, partially overlapping end regions that generate another 10,480 cleavage and polyadenylation sites that had gone largely unnoticed and represent potential evolutionary intermediates of progressive UTR shortening. Moreover, a third of the convergently transcribed genes use palindromic arrangements of bidirectional elements to specify UTRs with convergent overlap, which also contributes to genome compaction by eliminating regions between genes. Although nematode 3'UTRs have median length only one-sixth that of mammalian 3'UTRs, they have twice the density of conserved microRNA sites, in part because additional types of seed-complementary sites are preferentially conserved. These findings reveal the influence of cleavage and polyadenylation on the evolution of genome architecture and provide resources for studying post-transcriptional gene regulation.","Jan CH, Friedman RC, Ruby JG, Bartel DP."],["19181841","Massively parallel sequencing of the polyadenylated transcriptome of C. elegans.","Genome Res","2009-Apr","SRA003622","Using massively parallel sequencing by synthesis methods, we have surveyed the polyA+ transcripts from four stages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to an unprecedented depth.

The data provide experimental support for >85% of the annotated protein-coding transcripts in WormBase (WS170) and confirm additional details of processing. For example, the total number of confirmed splice junctions was raised from 70,911 to over 98,000. The data also suggest thousands of modifications to WormBase annotations and identify new spliced junctions and genes not part of any WormBase annotation, including at least 80 putative genes not found in any of three predicted gene sets. The quantitative nature of the data also suggests that mRNA levels may be measured by this approach with unparalleled precision.

Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. It is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. The analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs.

Individual non-coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein-coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure. Deep sequencing of small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE (cap-analysis of gene expression) tags, which mark the 5' ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter-associated small RNAs, appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and non-coding genes, sometimes crossing exon-exon junctions.

Until now, such studies of have only included microarray or short length sequence tags for transcript profiling. Furthermore, most comparisons of transcript and protein levels have been based on absolute expression values from within the same tissue and not relative expression values based on tissue ratios.Presented here is a novel study of two porcine tissues based on integrative analysis of data from expression profiling of identical samples using cDNA microarray, 454-sequencing and iTRAQ-based proteomics. Sequence homology identified 2.541 unique transcripts that are detectable by both microarray hybridizations and 454-sequencing of 1.2 million cDNA tags. Both transcript-based technologies showed high reproducibility between sample replicates of the same tissue, but the correlation across these two technologies was modest. Thousands of genes being differentially expressed were identified with microarray. Out of the 306 differentially expressed genes, identified by 454-sequencing, 198 (65%) were also found by microarray. The relationship between the regulation of transcript and protein levels was analyzed by integrating iTRAQ-based proteomics data. Protein expression ratios were determined for 354 genes, of which 148 could be mapped to both microarray and 454-sequencing data. A comparison of the expression ratios from the three technologies revealed that differences in transcript and protein levels across heart and muscle tissues are positively correlated.We show that the reproducibility within cDNA microarray and 454-sequencing is high, but that the agreement across these two technologies is modest. We demonstrate that the regulation of transcript and protein levels across identical tissue samples is positively correlated when the tissue expression ratios are used for comparison. The results presented are of interest in systems biology research in terms of integration and analysis of high-throughput expression data from mammalian tissues.","Hornshøj H, Bendixen E, Conley LN, Andersen PK, Hedegaard J, Panitz F, Bendixen C."]],["SRP000532","no study abstract","Hornsh*j H, Bendixen E, Conley LN, Andersen PK, Hedegaard J, Panitz F and Bendixen C: Positive correlation between transcript and protein heart-muscle expression ratios in pig obtained by 454-sequencing and iTRAQ-based proteomics in a comparative study with cDNA microarray (2007, unpublished).

They are thought to function primarily as inhibitors of gene activity by attenuating translation or promoting mRNA degradation. A typical miRNA gene produces a predominant approximately 21-nucleotide (nt) RNA (the miRNA) along with a less abundant miRNA(*) product. We sought to identify miRNAs from the simple chordate Ciona intestinalis through comprehensive sequencing of small RNA libraries created from different developmental stages. Unexpectedly, half of the identified miRNA loci encode up to four distinct, stable small RNAs. The additional RNAs, miRNA-offset RNAs (moRs), are generated from sequences immediately adjacent to the predicted approximately 60-nt pre-miRNA. moRs seem to be produced by RNAse III-like processing, are approximately 20 nt long and, like miRNAs, are observed at specific developmental stages.

More than 20 million 25-base 5'-end tags were obtained from untreated and 5Aza-treated cells and matched to sequences within the human genome. Seventy three percent of the mapped unique tags were associated with RefSeq cDNA sequences, corresponding to approximately 14,000 different protein-coding genes in this single cell type. The level of expression of these genes ranged from 0.02 to 4,704 transcripts per cell. The sensitivity of a single sequence run of the SOLiD platform was 100-1,000 fold greater than that observed from 5'end SAGE data generated from the analysis of 70,000 tags obtained by Sanger sequencing.

Despite being rich data sources, they have not been used much due to the difficulty in locating and analyzing datasets of interest.Geoseq http://geoseq.mssm.edu provides a new method of analyzing short reads from deep sequencing experiments. Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. It is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. The analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs. The ease of using Geoseq for these analyses suggests its utility and uniqueness as an analysis tool.","Gurtowski J, Cancio A, Shah H, Levovitz C, George A, Homann R, Sachidanandam R."],["18922463","A piRNA pathway primed by individual transposons is linked to de novo DNA methylation in mice.","Mol Cell","2008-Sep-26","SRA008237","piRNAs and Piwi proteins have been implicated in transposon control and are linked to transposon methylation in mammals.

In addition to miRNAs, other bilaterian small RNAs, known as Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), protect the genome from transposons. Here we identify small RNAs from animal phyla that diverged before the emergence of the Bilateria. The cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (starlet sea anemone), a close relative to the Bilateria, possesses an extensive repertoire of miRNA genes, two classes of piRNAs and a complement of proteins specific to small-RNA biology comparable to that of humans. The poriferan Amphimedon queenslandica (sponge), one of the simplest animals and a distant relative of the Bilateria, also possesses miRNAs, both classes of piRNAs and a full complement of the small-RNA machinery. Animal miRNA evolution seems to have been relatively dynamic, with precursor sizes and mature miRNA sequences differing greatly between poriferans, cnidarians and bilaterians. Nonetheless, miRNAs and piRNAs have been available as classes of riboregulators to shape gene expression throughout the evolution and radiation of animal phyla.","Grimson A, Srivastava M, Fahey B, Woodcroft BJ, Chiang HR, King N, Degnan BM, Rokhsar DS, Bartel DP."]],["SRP000624","no study abstract","We explored the potential for small RNA biology in organisms that diverged basal to Bilateria, identifying both miRNAs and piRNAs in Nematsotella and Amphimedon."],[["SRX003090","no description for experiment design","Trizol extracted whole RNA.

Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. It is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. The analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs. The ease of using Geoseq for these analyses suggests its utility and uniqueness as an analysis tool.","Gurtowski J, Cancio A, Shah H, Levovitz C, George A, Homann R, Sachidanandam R."],["18692474","Connecting microRNA genes to the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of embryonic stem cells.","Cell","2008-Aug-8","SRA009450","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial for normal embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal and cellular differentiation, but how miRNA gene expression is controlled by the key transcriptional regulators of ES cells has not been established.

Hundreds of genes were directly repressed, albeit each to a modest degree, by individual microRNAs. Although some targets were repressed without detectable changes in mRNA levels, those translationally repressed by more than a third also displayed detectable mRNA destabilization, and, for the more highly repressed targets, mRNA destabilization usually comprised the major component of repression.

A major system that controls the activity of transposable elements (TEs) in flies and vertebrates is mediated by Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which are approximately 24-30 nucleotide RNAs that are bound by Piwi-class effectors. The piRNA system is thought to provide primarily a germline defense against TE activity.Here, we describe a second system that represses Drosophila TEs by using endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are 21 nucleotide, 3'-end-modified RNAs that are dependent on Dicer-2 and Argonaute-2. In contrast to piRNAs, we find that the TE-siRNA system is active in somatic tissues, and particularly so in various immortalized cell lines. Analysis of the patterns and properties of TE-derived small RNAs reveals further distinctions between TE regions and genomic loci that are converted into piRNAs and siRNAs, respectively. Finally, functional tests show that many transposon transcripts accumulate to higher levels in cells and animal tissues that are deficient for Dicer-2 or Argonaute-2.Drosophila utilizes two small-RNA systems to restrict transposon activity in the germline (mostly via piRNAs) and in the soma (mostly via siRNAs).","Chung WJ, Okamura K, Martin R, Lai EC."]],["SRP003879","no study abstract","Summary: High-throughput sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs.\ntotal RNA, ~18-26nt RNAs isolated using PAGE, ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH\nOverall Design: Small RNAs were sequenced from D. melanogaster heads (male and female), body (male and female), S2 and Kc cells and different stages of embryo.

We find that ABH1/CBP80 is necessary to obtain proper mature miRNA levels, which suggests this protein affects the miRNA-mediated RNA silencing pathway.

Whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling microarrays were used for gene expression studies of the entire transcriptome for wildtype Col-0, abh1-1, ein5-6, and ein5-6 abh1-1 plants.Micro (mi)RNAs and small-interfering (si)RNAs are abundant endogenous small (sm)RNAs that control transcript expression by post-transcriptional gene silencing. Here, we show that concomitant loss of XRN4/EIN5, a 5�-3� exoribonuclease, and CBP80/ABH1, the largest subunit of the mRNA cap binding complex, results in Arabidopsis plants manifesting myriad developmental defects. Through the analysis of ein5 abh1 double mutant plants, we find that CBP80/ABH1 regulates the levels of mature miRNAs, which suggests this protein is a novel component of the miRNA-mediated RNA silencing pathway. Additionally, we show that a novel class of smRNAs are processed from both sense and anti-sense strands of ~130 endogenous transcripts that apparently are converted to double-stranded RNA and subsequently processed into smRNAs, and accumulate in the absence of XRN4/EIN5. Moreover, we demonstrate that accumulation of these smRNAs is often synergistically increased in ein5 abh1 double mutant plants, which suggests that these proteins act coordinately to regulate the substrates from which they are processed. Finally, we find that the parent transcripts of these novel smRNAs accumulate in an uncapped form upon loss of XRN4/EIN5. These results suggest that uncapped endogenous transcripts can shuttle into an RNA silencing pathway where they become smRNA biogenesis substrates.

The main limitation of this approach is that examples from both classes are required which might be infeasible in certain cases, especially those dealing with biological data. Such is the case for membrane-binding peripheral domains that play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking by reversibly binding to membranes. For these domains, a well-defined positive set is available with domains known to bind membrane along with a large unlabeled set of domains whose membrane binding affinities have not been measured. The aforementioned limitation can be addressed by a special class of semi-supervised machine learning called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning that uses a positive set with a large unlabeled set. METHODS In this study, we implement the first application of PU-learning to a protein function prediction problem: identification of peripheral domains. PU-learning starts by identifying reliable negative (RN) examples iteratively from the unlabeled set until convergence and builds a classifier using the positive and the final RN set. A data set of 232 positive cases and ~3750 unlabeled ones were used to construct and validate the protocol.Holdout evaluation of the protocol on a left-out positive set showed that the accuracy of prediction reached up to 95% during two independent implementations.These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains. Protocols like the one presented here become particularly useful in the case of availability of information from one class only.","Bhardwaj N, Gerstein M, Lu H."],["18423832","Highly integrated single-base resolution maps of the epigenome in Arabidopsis.","Cell","2008-May-2","SRA000286","Deciphering the multiple layers of epigenetic regulation that control transcription is critical to understanding how plants develop and respond to their environment.

Finally, strand-specific mRNA-seq revealed altered transcript abundance of hundreds of genes, transposons, and unannotated intergenic transcripts upon modification of the DNA methylation state.","Lister R, O'Malley RC, Tonti-Filippini J, Gregory BD, Berry CC, Millar AH, Ecker JR."]],["SRP000551","no study abstract","Small RNA sequencing of wildtype Arabidopsis plants (Columbia-0), and met1, drm1 drm2 cmt3, and ros1 dml2 dml3 null mutants using the Illumina Genetic Analyzer."],[["SRX002508","no description for experiment design","smRNA-seq library construction protocol: Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

Despite being rich data sources, they have not been used much due to the difficulty in locating and analyzing datasets of interest.Geoseq http://geoseq.mssm.edu provides a new method of analyzing short reads from deep sequencing experiments. Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. It is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. The analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs. The ease of using Geoseq for these analyses suggests its utility and uniqueness as an analysis tool.","Gurtowski J, Cancio A, Shah H, Levovitz C, George A, Homann R, Sachidanandam R."],["18403677","Endogenous siRNAs derived from transposons and mRNAs in Drosophila somatic cells.","Science","2008-May-23","SRA001013","Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct RNA interference (RNAi) in eukaryotes.

We report here that antisense transcription of the Hox miRNA locus mir-iab-4 generates the novel pre-miRNA hairpin mir-iab-8, which is then processed into endogenous mature miRNAs. Sense and antisense iab-4/iab-8 miRNAs are functionally distinguished by their distinct domains of expression and targeting capabilities. We find that miR-iab-8-5p, like miR-iab-4-5p, is also relevant to Hox gene regulation. Ectopic mir-iab-8 can strongly repress the Hox genes Ultrabithorax and abdominal-A via extensive arrays of conserved target sites, and can induce a dramatic homeotic transformation of halteres into wings. We generalize the antisense miRNA principle by showing that several other loci in both invertebrates and vertebrates are endogenously processed on their antisense strands into mature miRNAs with distinct seeds. These findings demonstrate that antisense transcription and processing contributes to the functional diversification of miRNA genes.","Tyler DM, Okamura K, Chung WJ, Hagen JW, Berezikov E, Hannon GJ, Lai EC."]],["SRP003801","no study abstract","Summary: \n\n\nHigh-throughput sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs.\ntotal RNA, ~18-26nt RNAs isolated using PAGE, ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH\nKeywords: High-throughput solexa sequencing\nOverall Design: Small RNAs were sequenced from D. melanogaster female head.

The increase in nitrate availability in soils is important for plant nutrition, but it also has considerable impact on groundwater pollution owing to leaching. Here we show that archaeal ammonia oxidizers are more abundant in soils than their well-known bacterial counterparts. We investigated the abundance of the gene encoding a subunit of the key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) in 12 pristine and agricultural soils of three climatic zones. amoA gene copies of Crenarchaeota (Archaea) were up to 3,000-fold more abundant than bacterial amoA genes. High amounts of crenarchaeota-specific lipids, including crenarchaeol, correlated with the abundance of archaeal amoA gene copies. Furthermore, reverse transcription quantitative PCR studies and complementary DNA analysis using novel cloning-independent pyrosequencing technology demonstrated the activity of the archaea in situ and supported the numerical dominance of archaeal over bacterial ammonia oxidizers. Our results indicate that crenarchaeota may be the most abundant ammonia-oxidizing organisms in soil ecosystems on Earth.","Leininger S, Urich T, Schloter M, Schwark L, Qi J, Nicol GW, Prosser JI, Schuster SC, Schleper C."]],["SRP000182","RNA-centered meta-transcriptomic approach to simultaneously obtain information on both structure and function of a soil community.","Soil ecosystems harbor the most complex prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities on Earth.
