Mortality often appears without prior clinical signs, typically shortly prior to slaughter. We recently reported the finding and the complete genomic sequence of a novel piscine reovirus (PRV), which is associated with another cardiac disease in Atlantic salmon; heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI). In the present work we have studied whether PRV or other infectious agents may be involved in the etiology of CMS.Using high throughput sequencing on heart samples from natural outbreaks of CMS and from fish experimentally challenged with material from fish diagnosed with CMS a high number of sequence reads identical to the PRV genome were identified. In addition, a sequence contig from a novel totivirus could also be constructed. Using RT-qPCR, levels of PRV in tissue samples were quantified and the totivirus was detected in all samples tested from CMS fish but not in controls. In situ hybridization supported this pattern indicating a possible association between CMS and the novel piscine totivirus.Although causality for CMS in Atlantic salmon could not be proven for either of the two viruses, our results are compatible with a hypothesis where, in the experimental challenge studied, PRV behaves as an opportunist whereas the totivirus might be more directly linked with the development of CMS.","Løvoll M, Wiik-Nielsen J, Grove S, Wiik-Nielsen CR, Kristoffersen AB, Faller R, Poppe T, Jung J, Pedamallu CS, Nederbragt AJ, Meyerson M, Rimstad E, Tengs T."],[["SRA012648"],["SRP002394","Summary: Background: A comprehensive transcriptome survey, or \"gene atlas\", provides information essential for a complete understanding of the genomic biology of an organism. We present an atlas of RNA abundance for 92 adult, juvenile and fetal cattle tissues and 3 cattle cell lines.    Results: The Bovine Gene Atlas was generated from 7.2 million unique digital gene expression tag sequences (300.2 million total raw tag sequences), from which 1.59 million unique tag sequences were identified that mapped to the bovine genome accounting for 85% of the total raw tag abundance. Filtering these tags yielded 87,764 unique tag sequences that unambiguously mapped to 16,517 annotated protein-coding loci in the genome accounting for 45% of the total raw tag abundance. Clustering of tissues based on tag abundance profiles generally confirmed ontology classification based on anatomy. There were 5,429 constitutively expressed loci and 3,445 constitutively expressed unique tag sequences mapping outside annotated gene boundaries that represent a resource for enhancing current gene models. Physical measures such as inferred transcript length or antisense tag abundance identified tissues with atypical transcriptional tag profiles.  We report for the first time the tissue specific variation in the proportion of mitochondrial transcriptional tag abundance. The Bovine Gene Atlas can be examined at http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/bovineatlas .    Conclusions: The Bovine Gene Atlas is the deepest and broadest transcriptome survey of any livestock genome to date.  Commonalities and variation in sense and antisense transcript tag profiles identified in different tissues facilitate the examination of the relationship between gene expression, tissue, and gene function.

In brief, total RNA aliquots (1 or 2 μg) were diluted in 50 uL of nuclease-free H2O and heated at 65oC for 5 min to disrupt secondary structure prior to incubation with magnetic oligo-dT beads to capture the poly-adenylated RNA fraction.  First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.

Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.

Residual red blood cells were removed from the buffy coat by resuspending twice in 140 mM NH4Cl; 17 mM Tris/HCl and collecting the unlysed cells by repeating centrifugation after each resuspension. All samples were stored at -80oC until sonicated or pulverized and then homogenized using a polytron homogenizer for extraction of total RNA with TRIZOL (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) using the manufacturer's protocol.  The integrity of the RNA was confirmed a 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano-chip (Agilent - Santa Clara, CA).  The samples used had an average RIN value of 8.0 and 28S:18S rRNA ratio of 1.42.\n\nTag Library Construction and Sequencing: Tag library preparation was performed at Illumina (formerly Solexa, Hayward, CA) using a progenitor version of DGE-Tag Profiling DpnII Sample Prep kit and protocol. In brief, total RNA aliquots (1 or 2 μg) were diluted in 50 uL of nuclease-free H2O and heated at 65oC for 5 min to disrupt secondary structure prior to incubation with magnetic oligo-dT beads to capture the poly-adenylated RNA fraction.  First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.  Unbound cDNA fragments were washed away prior to ligation with GEX DpnII adapter to the 5’ end of the bead-bound digested cDNA fragments. This adapter contains a restriction site for MmeI that cuts 17 bp downstream from the DpnII site.  After subsequent digestion with MmeI, 21 bp tags starting with the DpnII recognition sequence were recovered from the beads and dephosphorylated prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.  Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.  The resulting fragments were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel debris with 1× NEBuffer 2 by gentle rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Gel debris were removed using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (2 ml, 0.45 µm) and the DNA was precipitated by adding 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 325 µl of ethanol (–20°C), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After washing the pellet with 70% ethanol, the DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.5 and quantified with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.  Sequencing using Solexa/Illumina Whole Genome SequencerCluster generation was performed after applying 4 pM of each sample to the individual lanes of the Illumina 1G flowcell.

In brief, total RNA aliquots (1 or 2 μg) were diluted in 50 uL of nuclease-free H2O and heated at 65oC for 5 min to disrupt secondary structure prior to incubation with magnetic oligo-dT beads to capture the poly-adenylated RNA fraction.  First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.  Unbound cDNA fragments were washed away prior to ligation with GEX DpnII adapter to the 5’ end of the bead-bound digested cDNA fragments. This adapter contains a restriction site for MmeI that cuts 17 bp downstream from the DpnII site.  After subsequent digestion with MmeI, 21 bp tags starting with the DpnII recognition sequence were recovered from the beads and dephosphorylated prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.  Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.  The resulting fragments were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel debris with 1× NEBuffer 2 by gentle rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Gel debris were removed using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (2 ml, 0.45 µm) and the DNA was precipitated by adding 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 325 µl of ethanol (–20°C), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After washing the pellet with 70% ethanol, the DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.5 and quantified with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.

First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.  Unbound cDNA fragments were washed away prior to ligation with GEX DpnII adapter to the 5’ end of the bead-bound digested cDNA fragments. This adapter contains a restriction site for MmeI that cuts 17 bp downstream from the DpnII site.  After subsequent digestion with MmeI, 21 bp tags starting with the DpnII recognition sequence were recovered from the beads and dephosphorylated prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.  Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.  The resulting fragments were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel debris with 1× NEBuffer 2 by gentle rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Gel debris were removed using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (2 ml, 0.45 µm) and the DNA was precipitated by adding 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 325 µl of ethanol (–20°C), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After washing the pellet with 70% ethanol, the DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.5 and quantified with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.

Residual red blood cells were removed from the buffy coat by resuspending twice in 140 mM NH4Cl; 17 mM Tris/HCl and collecting the unlysed cells by repeating centrifugation after each resuspension. All samples were stored at -80oC until sonicated or pulverized and then homogenized using a polytron homogenizer for extraction of total RNA with TRIZOL (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) using the manufacturer's protocol.  The integrity of the RNA was confirmed a 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano-chip (Agilent - Santa Clara, CA).  The samples used had an average RIN value of 8.0 and 28S:18S rRNA ratio of 1.42.\n\nTag Library Construction and Sequencing: Tag library preparation was performed at Illumina (formerly Solexa, Hayward, CA) using a progenitor version of DGE-Tag Profiling DpnII Sample Prep kit and protocol. In brief, total RNA aliquots (1 or 2 μg) were diluted in 50 uL of nuclease-free H2O and heated at 65oC for 5 min to disrupt secondary structure prior to incubation with magnetic oligo-dT beads to capture the poly-adenylated RNA fraction.  First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.  Unbound cDNA fragments were washed away prior to ligation with GEX DpnII adapter to the 5’ end of the bead-bound digested cDNA fragments. This adapter contains a restriction site for MmeI that cuts 17 bp downstream from the DpnII site.  After subsequent digestion with MmeI, 21 bp tags starting with the DpnII recognition sequence were recovered from the beads and dephosphorylated prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.  Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.  The resulting fragments were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel debris with 1× NEBuffer 2 by gentle rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Gel debris were removed using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (2 ml, 0.45 µm) and the DNA was precipitated by adding 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 325 µl of ethanol (–20°C), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After washing the pellet with 70% ethanol, the DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.5 and quantified with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.  Sequencing using Solexa/Illumina Whole Genome SequencerCluster generation was performed after applying 4 pM of each sample to the individual lanes of the Illumina 1G flowcell.

The samples used had an average RIN value of 8.0 and 28S:18S rRNA ratio of 1.42.\n\nTag Library Construction and Sequencing: Tag library preparation was performed at Illumina (formerly Solexa, Hayward, CA) using a progenitor version of DGE-Tag Profiling DpnII Sample Prep kit and protocol. In brief, total RNA aliquots (1 or 2 μg) were diluted in 50 uL of nuclease-free H2O and heated at 65oC for 5 min to disrupt secondary structure prior to incubation with magnetic oligo-dT beads to capture the poly-adenylated RNA fraction.  First and second-strand cDNA was synthesized and bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with DpnII to retain a cDNA fragment from the 3’-most GATC to the poly(A)-tail.  Unbound cDNA fragments were washed away prior to ligation with GEX DpnII adapter to the 5’ end of the bead-bound digested cDNA fragments. This adapter contains a restriction site for MmeI that cuts 17 bp downstream from the DpnII site.  After subsequent digestion with MmeI, 21 bp tags starting with the DpnII recognition sequence were recovered from the beads and dephosphorylated prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.  Then, a second adapter (GEX adapter 2) was ligated onto the 3’ end of the cDNA tag at the MmeI cleavage site.  The adapter-ligated cDNA tags were enriched by a 15-cycle PCR amplification using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers complementary to the adapter sequences.  The resulting fragments were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel debris with 1× NEBuffer 2 by gentle rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Gel debris were removed using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (2 ml, 0.45 µm) and the DNA was precipitated by adding 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 325 µl of ethanol (–20°C), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After washing the pellet with 70% ethanol, the DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.5 and quantified with a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer.  Sequencing using Solexa/Illumina Whole Genome SequencerCluster generation was performed after applying 4 pM of each sample to the individual lanes of the Illumina 1G flowcell. After hybridization of the sequencing primer to the single-stranded products, 18 cycles of base incorporation were carried out on the 1G analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.","SRS066081"],["SRX019878","no description for experiment design","Sample extraction and total RNA isolation: All bovine tissues were collected following USDA, ARS animal use and care protocols.

Resting murine NK cells regulate the translation of effector molecule mRNAs (e.g., granzyme B, GzmB) through unclear molecular mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the translation of their mRNA targets, and are therefore candidates for mediating this control process. While the expression and importance of miRNAs in T and B lymphocytes have been established, little is known about miRNAs in NK cells. Here, we used two next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms to define the miRNA transcriptomes of resting and cytokine-activated primary murine NK cells, with confirmation by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and microarrays. We delineate a bioinformatics analysis pipeline that identified 302 known and 21 novel mature miRNAs from sequences obtained from NK cell small RNA libraries. These miRNAs are expressed over a broad range and exhibit isomiR complexity, and a subset is differentially expressed following cytokine activation. Using these miRNA NGS data, miR-223 was identified as a mature miRNA present in resting NK cells with decreased expression following cytokine activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-223 specifically targets the 3' untranslated region of murine GzmB in vitro, indicating that this miRNA may contribute to control of GzmB translation in resting NK cells. Thus, the sequenced NK cell miRNA transcriptome provides a valuable framework for further elucidation of miRNA expression and function in NK cell biology.","Fehniger TA, Wylie T, Germino E, Leong JW, Magrini VJ, Koul S, Keppel CR, Schneider SE, Koboldt DC, Sullivan RP, Heinz ME, Crosby SD, Nagarajan R, Ramsingh G, Link DC, Ley TJ, Mardis ER."],[["SRA010343"],["SRP001588","Taxus cuspidata Sieb. et Zucc is mainly distrubuted in Northeast China and adjacent countries.

Huperzine A, which belongs to the lycodine type of lycopodium alkaloids, has been used as an anti-Alzheimer's disease drug candidate. Despite their medical importance, little genomic or transcriptomic data are available for the members of this family. We used massive parallel pyrosequencing on the Roche 454-GS FLX Titanium platform to generate a substantial EST dataset for Huperzia serrata (H. serrata) and Phlegmariurus carinatus (P. carinatus) as representative members of the Huperzia and Phlegmariurus genera, respectively. H. serrata and P. carinatus are important plants for research on the biosynthesis of lycopodium alkaloids. We focused on gene discovery in the areas of bioactive compound biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation as well as genetic marker detection in these species.For H. serrata, 36,763 unique putative transcripts were generated from 140,930 reads totaling over 57,028,559 base pairs; for P. carinatus, 31,812 unique putative transcripts were generated from 79,920 reads totaling over 30,498,684 base pairs. Using BLASTX searches of public databases, 16,274 (44.3%) unique putative transcripts from H. serrata and 14,070 (44.2%) from P. carinatus were assigned to at least one protein. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology annotations revealed that the functions of the unique putative transcripts from these two species cover a similarly broad set of molecular functions, biological processes and biochemical pathways.In particular, a total of 20 H. serrata candidate cytochrome P450 genes, which are more abundant in leaves than in roots and might be involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis, were found based on the comparison of H. serrata and P. carinatus 454-ESTs and real-time PCR analysis. Four unique putative CYP450 transcripts (Hs01891, Hs04010, Hs13557 and Hs00093) which are the most likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of lycopodium alkaloids were selected based on a phylogenetic analysis. Approximately 115 H. serrata and 98 P. carinatus unique putative transcripts associated with the biosynthesis of triterpenoids, alkaloids and flavones/flavonoids were located in the 454-EST datasets. Transcripts related to phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction as well as transcription factors were also obtained. In addition, we discovered 2,729 and 1,573 potential SSR-motif microsatellite loci in the H. serrata and P. carinatus 454-ESTs, respectively.The 454-EST resource allowed for the first large-scale acquisition of ESTs from H. serrata and P. carinatus, which are representative members of the Huperziaceae family. We discovered many genes likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds and transcriptional regulation as well as a large number of potential microsatellite markers. These results constitute an essential resource for understanding the molecular basis of developmental regulation and secondary metabolite biosynthesis (especially that of lycopodium alkaloids) in the Huperziaceae, and they provide an overview of the genetic diversity of this family.","Luo H, Li Y, Sun C, Wu Q, Song J, Sun Y, Steinmetz A, Chen S."],[["SRA023764"],["SRP003449","MicroRNAs fine-tune the activity of hundreds of protein-coding genes.

To better define microbial processes and activities associated with marine DOM cycling, we analyzed genomic and transcriptional responses of microbial communities to high-molecular-weight DOM (HMWDOM) addition. The cell density in the unamended control remained constant, with very few transcript categories exhibiting significant differences over time. In contrast, the DOM-amended microcosm doubled in cell numbers over 27 h, and a variety of HMWDOM-stimulated transcripts from different taxa were observed at all time points measured relative to the control. Transcripts significantly enriched in the HMWDOM treatment included those associated with two-component sensor systems, phosphate and nitrogen assimilation, chemotaxis, and motility. Transcripts from Idiomarina and Alteromonas spp., the most highly represented taxa at the early time points, included those encoding TonB-associated transporters, nitrogen assimilation genes, fatty acid catabolism genes, and TCA cycle enzymes. At the final time point, Methylophaga rRNA and non-rRNA transcripts dominated the HMWDOM-amended microcosm, and included gene transcripts associated with both assimilatory and dissimilatory single-carbon compound utilization. The data indicated specific resource partitioning of DOM by different bacterial species, which results in a temporal succession of taxa, metabolic pathways, and chemical transformations associated with HMWDOM turnover.

The alteration of these 88 reaction fluxes led to a detailed network-wide flux mapping that was able to capture the suboptimal cellular state of C. thermocellum.","Gowen CM, Fong SS."],[["SRA011534"],["SRP002004","Transcription is the first step connecting genetic information with an organism's phenotype.

We applied miRNA-, mRNA-, and ChIP-Seq to characterize the microRNome during lymphopoiesis within the context of the transcriptome and epigenome. We show that lymphocyte-specific miRNAs are either tightly controlled by polycomb group-mediated H3K27me3 or maintained in a semi-activated epigenetic state prior to full expression. Because of miRNA biogenesis, the cellular concentration of mature miRNAs does not typically reflect transcriptional changes. However, we uncover a subset of miRNAs for which abundance is dictated by miRNA gene expression. We confirm that concentration of 5p and 3p miRNA strands depends largely on free energy properties of miRNA duplexes. Unexpectedly, we also find that miRNA strand accumulation can be developmentally regulated.

Although we observed correlations between Penelope transcription and dysgenesis, we could not correlate differences in maternally deposited Penelope piRNAs with the sterility of progeny.  Instead, we found that strains, which produced dysgenic progeny, differed in their production of piRNAs from clusters in sub-telomeric regions, possibly indicating that changes in the overall piRNA repertoire underlie dysgenesis.

RNA-based silencing strategies for transposons in the process of invading Drosophila species.","RNA","2010-Aug","Colonization of a host by an active transposon can increase mutation rates or cause sterility, a phenotype termed hybrid dysgenesis. As an example, intercrosses of certain Drosophila virilis strains can produce dysgenic progeny. The Penelope element is present only in a subset of laboratory strains and has been implicated as a causative agent of the dysgenic phenotype. We have also introduced Penelope into Drosophila melanogaster, which are otherwise naive to the element. We have taken advantage of these natural and experimentally induced colonization processes to probe the evolution of small RNA pathways in response to transposon challenge. In both species, Penelope was predominantly targeted by endo-small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) rather than by piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Although we do observe correlations between Penelope transcription and dysgenesis, we could not correlate differences in maternally deposited Penelope piRNAs with the sterility of progeny. Instead, we found that strains that produced dysgenic progeny differed in their production of piRNAs from clusters in subtelomeric regions, possibly indicating that changes in the overall piRNA repertoire underlie dysgenesis. Considered together, our data reveal unexpected plasticity in small RNA pathways in germ cells, both in the character of their responses to invading transposons and in the piRNA clusters that define their ability to respond to mobile elements.","Rozhkov NV, Aravin AA, Zelentsova ES, Schostak NG, Sachidanandam R, McCombie WR, Hannon GJ, Evgen'ev MB."],[["SRA012600"],["SRP002377","Background  Understanding the genetic basis of adaptive changes has been a major goal of evolutionary  biology. In complex organisms without sequenced genomes, de novo transcriptome assembly  using a longer read sequencing technology followed by expression profiling using short reads is  likely to provide comprehensive identification of adaptive variation at the expression level and  sequence polymorphisms in coding regions. We performed sequencing and de novo assembly of  the bank vole heart transcriptome in lines selected for high metabolism and unselected controls.  Results  A single 454 Titanium run produced over million reads, which were assembled into 63,581  contigs.

The volume of water was reduced to 2 microl by centrifugal evaporation at room temperature in the presence of 0.66 M D- Threalose (Nacalai Tesque), 3.3 M D-Sorbitol (WAKO), 100 microM of TS oligonucleotide TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGCA(rG)(rG)(rG), 10 microM of random RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCTN15 (Stangegaard et al., 2006) or 10 microM of polythimine RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT18. The oligonucleotides were added at this step because it helps to keep the final reaction volume low. They contain binding sites for the type III restriction enzyme EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992), indicated in bold, that will be used to extract 5' tags from the cDNAs. Trehalose and sorbitol protect RNAs against degradation and capture on tube walls by preventing the samples from drying completely. Furthermore, these poly-hydroxylated molecules thermoactivate the reverse transcriptase (RTase) at the next step (Carninci et al., 1998). The mixture was then was heat-denatured at 65 deg_C for 10 min in a thermocycler (MWG) and transferred quickly on a ice/water mixture, to avoid the formation  of  secondary  structures.  Reverse transcription and template switching were accomplished together in a volume of 10 microl with the following components: 1.25 x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 650 nM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 1.3 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 925 mM betaine (Spiess and Ivell, 2002) (WAKO) , and 200 units of SuperScriptII (Invitrogen). The reactions were incubated at 22 deg_C for 10 min, 50 deg_C for 30 min, 75 deg_C for 15 min in a thermocycler., and then immediately transferred on a ice/water mix. To prepare the second strand synthesis and amplification of the cDNAs, a small scale semi-suppressive PCR reaction was performed to evaluate the optimal number of cycles, defined as the last cycle before the intensity of the product ceases to increase. 10 microl aliquots were taken every two cycles and analyzed on 1% agarose gel. For each cDNA preparation, 2 microl of first strand cDNA were amplified in reactions of 100 microl using a mixture containing 1 x ExTaq Buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 100 nM forward PCR primer TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGC, 100 nM reverse PCR primer primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT, and 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa) with the following thermocycling program: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 15 s at 65 deg_C, 2 min at 68 deg_C) and using hot start. The rest of the cDNAs (6 microl each) were then processed in 4 reactions of 100 microl with the chosen number of cycles. PCR products were pooled and cleaned using CTAB and GE Healthcare GFX purification columns (to be published elsewhere). Tags were prepared from 45 microl of cDNA by enzymatic cleavage in 100 microl using 100 units of EcoP15I (NEB), 1 x buffer 3 (NEB), 1 mM ATP (NEB) and 100 ng/microl BSA (NEB), at 37 deg_C for 4 hours. We chose EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992) for tag generation, as it was reported to cut 25/27 bases downstream its binding site (Matsumura et al., 2003). In addition its non-palindromic DNA binding site strongly reduces the opportunities for the formation of PCR primer dimers during subsequent steps. Reactions were mixed with 130 microl of TE buffer and the low molecular weight cleavage products were purified through the Microcon YM-100 membranes (Millipore) by spinning 15 min at 500 x g. The columns were filled again with 130 microl of TE buffer and spun 15 min at 500 x g. The flow-through was then concentrated on Microcon YM-10 (Millipore) by spinning 20 min at 12,000 x g. The low molecular weight cleavage products were recovered by spinning 3 min at 1000 x g after flipping the cartridges. Ligation adapters were annealed by mixing equimolar amounts of two oligonucleotides, NNAGCTGTAGAACTCTGAACCTGT and ACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGCT, in a thermocycler at 95 deg_C and left to cool down to room temperature. 1 pmol of adapters was ligated to 10 microl of the EcoP15I cleavage products in 20 microl of 0.5 x \"Mighty\" DNA ligation mixture (TaKaRa) overnight at 16 deg_C in a thermocycler with lid heater (MWG). Optimal number of cycles for the ligation product to be amplified was determined  by  PCR  with  5 microM  of  forward  PCR  primer AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAG, 5 microM of  reverse  PCR  primer CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGATAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAG, 1 x ExTaq buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa).

Many loci are known to produce overlapping coding and noncoding RNAs with capped 5' ends that vary in size. Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region. Both of these methods allow further annotation-agnostic studies of the complex human transcriptome.","Plessy C, Bertin N, Takahashi H, Simone R, Salimullah M, Lassmann T, Vitezic M, Severin J, Olivarius S, Lazarevic D, Hornig N, Orlando V, Bell I, Gao H, Dumais J, Kapranov P, Wang H, Davis CA, Gingeras TR, Kawai J, Daub CO, Hayashizaki Y, Gustincich S, Carninci P."],[["DRA000169"],["DRP000169","Sequencing-based analysis of 5′ capped ends of RNAs have unveiled an unexpected complexity of the mammalian transcriptome, in which coding and non-coding RNAs produced in loci often harboring multiple promoters coexist with processed RNAs that exhibit a variety of 5′ modifications. In light of these discoveries, assessing whether novel transcription start sites (TSSs) are alternative promoters of known genes or promoters of newly identified transcripts require dedicated approaches. Furthermore, collecting such data from limiting amount of RNAs, such as microdissected cell types or from sub-cellular compartments with ex vivo samples—a necessary step to reduce the complexity of the studied transcriptome while keeping its biological relevance—often requires quantities of starting total RNA that are not sufficient for current protocols. Addressing both challenges, we developed nanoCAGE, a 5′ ends RNA profiling method of both poly-A+ and poly-A− transcripts that operates using as little as 10 ng of total RNA, coupled with CAGEscan, a technology for a gene-agnostic exploration of the transcriptome structure and dynamics, linking de novo-assembled transcripts to their regulatory regions","While the classic CAGE protocol requires a substantial number of biochemical processing steps, CAGEscan and nanoCAGE take advantage of a peculiar property of reverse transcriptase, called “template switching” to select 5′ ends of capped transcripts. This property allows proceeding directly from the first-strand cDNA synthesis to the addition of the second-strand cDNA primer at the 5′ end of the original RNA sequence without purification steps, thereby avoiding loss of material. This approach exploits the ability of the reverse-transcriptase to extend the cDNA using the mRNA’s cap as a template: the resulting neo-synthesized first strand cDNA carries one to three C nucleotides in correspondence of the cap structure. These Cs are hybridized to the ribo-G at the 3′ end of a template switching (TS) oligonucleotide. Then, the reverse transcriptase extends cDNA polymerization using the TS oligonucleotide as template, providing extra 3′ sequences to the first-strand cDNA. Due to the selectivity of the template switch for capped molecules, both protocols were used on total RNA, without depletion of ribosomal RNAs. Notably, the usage of 3′ random primer allows the detection of non-coding, non-polyadenylated RNAs. In the CAGEscan protocol, cDNAs are not cleaved, but directly prepared for sequencing by a second PCR which adds the adapter sequences needed to bridge PCR in the Illumina Genome Analyzers. In contrast with the nanoCAGE protocol, sequencing of both the 5′ end and the 3′ end of the template-switched captured cDNAs yields collections of 3′ ends reads “scanning” transcripts that can be unequivocally defined by their common 5′ end. Yet, unlike nanoCAGE libraries that contain uniformly short sequences, CAGEscan libraries are composed of sequences of broader size range including fragments longer than 1 kb, which poorly perform on currently available second-generation sequencing platform. However, since CAGEscan exclusively uses random primers at high concentration and commercial reverse transcriptases do not have a strong strand displacement activity, CAGEscan sequencing templates prepared by our optimized protocol are kept relatively short, regardless the length of the original mRNA molecules."],[["DRX000214","no description for experiment design","no description for

structures and functions of mammalian transcripts. Many loci are known to produce overlapping coding and noncoding RNAs with capped 5' ends that vary in size. Methods to identify the 5' ends of transcripts will facilitate the discovery of new promoters and 5' ends derived from secondary capping events. Such methods often require high input amounts of RNA not obtainable from highly refined samples such as tissue microdissections and subcellular fractions. Therefore, we developed nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE), a method that captures the 5' ends of transcripts from as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and CAGEscan, a mate-pair adaptation of nanoCAGE that captures the transcript 5' ends linked to a downstream region. Both of these methods allow further annotation-agnostic studies of the complex human transcriptome.","Plessy C, Bertin N, Takahashi H, Simone R, Salimullah M, Lassmann T, Vitezic M, Severin J, Olivarius S, Lazarevic D, Hornig N, Orlando V, Bell I, Gao H, Dumais J, Kapranov P, Wang H, Davis CA, Gingeras TR, Kawai J, Daub CO, Hayashizaki Y, Gustincich S, Carninci P."],[["SRA010777"],["SRP001707","no study abstract","no study description"],[["SRX015704","We applied a transcriptome profiling on a non-model marine fouling organism Bugula neritina.

The acquisition of a total of nearly 500 million short cDNA sequences allowed construction of temporal strand-specific maps of the entire VACV transcriptome at single-base resolution and analysis of over 14,000 host mRNAs.

The high resolution permitted determination of the precise boundaries of many mRNAs including read-through transcripts and location of mRNA start sites and adjacent promoters. Temporal analysis revealed two clusters of early mRNAs that were synthesized in the presence of inhibitors of protein as well as DNA synthesis, indicating that they do not correspond to separate immediate- and delayed-early classes as defined for other DNA viruses. The proportion of viral RNAs reached 25–55% of the total at 4 h. This rapid change, resulting in a relative decrease of the vast majority of host mRNAs, can contribute to the profound shutdown of host protein synthesis and blunting of antiviral responses. At 2 h, however, a minority of cellular mRNAs was increased.

It plays a significant role in bentho-pelagic coupling and hence has been proposed as a sentinel species for climate change monitoring. Previous studies have shown that this mollusc displays a high level of plasticity with regard to shell deposition and damage repair against a background of genetic homogeneity. The Southern Ocean has amongst the lowest present-day CaCO3 saturation rate of any ocean region, and is predicted to be among the first to become undersaturated under current ocean acidification scenarios. Hence, this species presents as an ideal candidate for studies into the processes of calcium regulation and shell deposition in our changing ocean environments.454 sequencing of L. elliptica mantle tissue generated 18,290 contigs with an average size of 535 bp (ranging between 142 bp-5.591 kb). BLAST sequence similarity searching assigned putative function to 17% of the data set, with a significant proportion of these transcripts being involved in binding and potentially of a secretory nature, as defined by GO molecular function and biological process classifications. These results indicated that the mantle is a transcriptionally active tissue which is actively proliferating. All transcripts were screened against an in-house database of genes shown to be involved in extracellular matrix formation and calcium homeostasis in metazoans. Putative identifications were made for a number of classical shell deposition genes, such as tyrosinase, carbonic anhydrase and metalloprotease 1, along with novel members of the family 2 G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). A membrane transport protein (SEC61) was also characterised and this demonstrated the utility of the clam sequence data as a resource for examining cold adapted amino acid substitutions. The sequence data contained 46,235 microsatellites and 13,084 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs/INDELS), providing a resource for population and also gene function studies.This is the first 454 data from an Antarctic marine invertebrate. Sequencing of mantle tissue from this non-model species has considerably increased resources for the investigation of the processes of shell deposition and repair in molluscs in a changing environment. A number of promising candidate genes were identified for functional analyses, which will be the subject of further investigation in this species and also used in model-hopping experiments in more tractable and economically important model aquaculture species, such as Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus edulis.","Clark MS, Thorne MA, Vieira FA, Cardoso JC, Power DM, Peck LS."],[["SRA012273"],["SRP002142","The plant pathogenic basidiomycete Sclerotium rolfsii produces the industrially exploited exopolysaccharide scleroglucan, a polymer that consists of %u03B2-1,3 linked glucose with a %u03B2-1,6 glycosyl branch on every third unit.

Using comparative transcriptomics, namely Agilent microarray hybridization and suppression subtractive hybridization, we identified approximately 800 unigenes which are differently expressed under scleroglucan-producing and non-producing conditions. From these, candidate genes were identified which could represent potential leads for targeted modification of the S. rolfsii metabolism for increased scleroglucan yields.The results presented in this paper provide for the first time genomic and transcriptomic data about S. rolfsii and demonstrate the power and usefulness of combined transcriptome sequencing and comparative microarray analysis.

We built Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) libraries for two charophyte species, Coleochaete orbicularis (Coleochaetales) and Spirogyra pratensis (Zygnematales). We used both Sanger sequencing and next generation 454 sequencing to cover as much of the transcriptome as possible. RESULTS: Our sequencing effort for Spirogyra pratensis yielded 9,984 5' Sanger reads plus 598,460 GS FLX Standard 454 sequences; Coleochaete orbicularis yielded 4,992 5' Sanger reads plus 673,811 GS FLX Titanium 454 sequences. After clustering S. pratensis yielded 12,000 unique transcripts, or unigenes, and C. orbicularis yielded 19,000. Both transcriptomes were very plant-like, i.e. most of the transcripts were more similar to streptophytes (land plants + charophyte green algae) than to other green algae in the sister group chlorophytes. BLAST results of several land plant genes hypothesized to be important in early land plant evolution resulted in high quality hits in both transcriptomes revealing putative orthologs ripe for follow-up studies. CONCLUSIONS: Two main conclusions were drawn from this study. One illustrates the utility of next generation sequencing for transcriptome studies: larger scale data collection at a lower cost enabled us to cover a considerable portion of the transcriptome for both species. And, two, that the charophyte green algal transcriptoms are remarkably plant-like, which gives them the unique capacity to be major players for future evolutionary genomic studies addressing origin of land plant questions.","Timme RE, Delwiche CF."],[["SRA012376"],["SRP002236","Recent high-throughput sequencing protocols have uncovered the complexity of mammalian transcription by RNA polymerase II, helping to define several initiation patterns in which transcription start sites (TSSs) cluster within both narrow and broad genomic windows.

However, previous approaches for sequencing cDNA clones were expensive or time-consuming, and therefore, a fast and efficient sequencing approach was demanded.We developed a program, MuSICA 2, that assembles millions of short (36-nucleotide) reads collected from a single flow cell lane of Illumina Genome Analyzer to shotgun-sequence approximately 800 human full-length cDNA clones. MuSICA 2 performs a hybrid assembly in which an external de novo assembler is run first and the result is then improved by reference alignment of shotgun reads. We compared the MuSICA 2 assembly with 200 pooled full-length cDNA clones finished independently by the conventional primer-walking using Sanger sequencers. The exon-intron structure of the coding sequence was correct for more than 95% of the clones with coding sequence annotation when we excluded cDNA clones insufficiently represented in the shotgun library due to PCR failure (42 out of 200 clones excluded), and the nucleotide-level accuracy of coding sequences of those correct clones was over 99.99%. We also applied MuSICA 2 to full-length cDNA clones from Toxoplasma gondii, to confirm that its ability was competent even for non-human species.The entire sequencing and shotgun assembly takes less than 1 week and the consumables cost only approximately US$3 per clone, demonstrating a significant advantage over previous approaches.","Kuroshu RM, Watanabe J, Sugano S, Morishita S, Suzuki Y, Kasahara M."],[["SRA017691"],["SRP002489","no study abstract","Summary: \nAndrogen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the growth and development of the normal prostate and its malignant transformation.  More recently, a majority of prostate cancers have been shown to harbor recurrent gene fusions of the androgen-regulated gene, TMPRSS2, to the oncogenic ETS transcription factor ERG.  Here we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to explore the genome-wide localization of these transcription factors in human prostate cancer cell lines as well as tissues.  Unexpectedly, transcriptional networks emanating from AR and ERG were found to be highly overlapping.  Furthermore, AR was found to regulate known 5’ fusion partners in prostate cancer including TMPRSS2, as well as negatively regulating its own expression.  While induced by androgen through fusion to TMPRSS2, ERG itself was shown to inhibit AR expression and positively regulate the genomic locus of wild-type ERG, thus revealing multiple levels of molecular cross-talk between AR and ERG.  Importantly, androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells in which ERG is overexpressed are able to proliferate and invade in the absence of androgen.  Thus, we dissected the intertwined genomic landscape of two master transcriptional regulators of prostate cancer and suggest a role for ERG in maintaining transcriptional networks necessary for androgen-independent prostate cancer growth.

The Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia; Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) is a prominent species in population biology but had no previous genomic data.  Sequencing runs using two normalized cDNA collections from a genetically diverse pool of larvae, pupae, and adults yielded 608,053 ESTs (mean length =110 nucleotides), which assembled into 48,354 contigs (sets of overlapping DNA segments) and 59,943 singletons.  Blast comparisons confirmed the accuracy of the sequencing and assembly, and indicated the presence of ca. 9,000 unique genes, along with > 6,000 additional microarray-confirmed unannotated contigs. Average depth of coverage was 6.5 fold for the longest 4,800 contigs (348 to 2,849 bps in length), sufficient for detecting large numbers of SNPs.  Oligonucleotide microarray probes designed from the assembled sequences showed highly repeatable hybridization intensity and revealed biological differences among individuals. We conclude that 454 sequencing, when performed to provide sufficient coverage depth, allows de novo transcriptome assembly and a fast, cost effective, and reliable method for rapid development of functional genomic tools for non-model species.

To better understand hookworm biology and nematode parasitism, the present study generated a near complete transcriptome of the canine hookworm Ancylostoma caninum to a very high coverage using high throughput technology, and compared it to those of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the parasite Brugia malayi.The generated transcripts from four developmental stages, infective L3, serum stimulated L3, adult male and adult female, covered 93% of the A. caninum transcriptome. The broad diversity among nematode transcriptomes was confirmed, and an impact of parasitic adaptation on transcriptome diversity was inferred. Intra-population analysis showed that A. caninum has higher coding sequence diversity than humans. Examining the developmental expression profiles of A. caninum revealed major transitions in gene expression from larval stages to adult. Adult males expressed the highest number of selectively expressed genes, but adult female expressed the highest number of selective parasitism-related genes. Genes related to parasitism adaptation and A. caninum specific genes exhibited more expression selectivity while those conserved in nematodes tend to be consistently expressed. Parasitism related genes were expressed more selectively in adult male and female worms. The comprehensive analysis of digital expression profiles along with transcriptome comparisons enabled identification of a set of parasitism genes encoding secretory proteins in animal parasitic nematode.This study validated the usage of deep sequencing for gene expression profiling. Parasitic adaptation of the canine hookworm is related to its diversity and developmental dynamics. This comprehensive comparative genomic and expression study substantially improves our understanding of the basic biology and parasitism of hookworms and, is expected, in the long run, to accelerate research toward development of vaccines and novel anthelmintics.","Wang Z, Abubucker S, Martin J, Wilson RK, Hawdon J, Mitreva M."],[["SRA009986"],["SRP001350","Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor with highly variable clinical courses.

Despite being a model organism for studying entomology, population biology, plant protection, molecular interactions among plants, viruses and insects, only a few genomic sequences are available for this species. To investigate its transcriptome and determine the differences between viruliferous and naïve L. striatellus, we employed 454-FLX high-throughput pyrosequencing to generate EST databases of this insect.     Results: We obtained 201,281 and 218,681 high-quality reads from viruliferous and naïve L. striatellus, respectively, with an average read length as 230 bp. These reads were assembled into contigs and two EST databases were generated. When all reads were combined, 16,885 contigs and 24,607 singletons (a total of 41,492 unigenes) were obtained, which represents a transcriptome of the insect. BlastX search against the NCBI-NR database revealed that only 6,873 (16.6%) of these unigenes have significant matches. Comparison of the distribution of GO classification among viruliferous, naïve, and combined EST databases indicated that these libraries are broadly representative of the L. striatellus transcriptomes.

The observation that all the other species examined here contain either type 1 or 4 trichomes (not both) supports the conclusion that these two trichome types are the same. Most differences in metabolites between type 1 and 4 glands on the one hand and type 6 glands on the other are quantitative but not qualitative. Several glandular trichome types express genes associated with photosynthesis and carbon fixation, indicating that some carbon destined for specialized metabolism is likely fixed within the trichome secretory cells.

Several MIRNA families are conserved deeply through land plants, but many are present only in closely related species or are species specific. The finding of numerous evolutionarily young MIRNA, many with low expression and few if any targets, supports a rapid birth-death model for MIRNA evolution. A systematic analysis of MIRNA genes and families in the close relatives, Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, was conducted using both whole-genome comparisons and high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs. Orthologs of 143 A. thaliana MIRNA genes were identified in A. lyrata, with nine having significant sequence or processing changes that likely alter function. In addition, at least 13% of MIRNA genes in each species are unique, despite their relatively recent speciation (approximately 10 million years ago). Alignment of MIRNA foldbacks to the Arabidopsis genomes revealed evidence for recent origins of 32 families by inverted or direct duplication of mostly protein-coding gene sequences, but less than half of these yield miRNA that are predicted to target transcripts from the originating gene family. miRNA nucleotide divergence between A. lyrata and A. thaliana orthologs was higher for young MIRNA genes, consistent with reduced purifying selection compared with deeply conserved MIRNA genes. Additionally, target sites of younger miRNA were lost more frequently than for deeply conserved families. In summary, our systematic analyses emphasize the dynamic nature of the MIRNA complement of plant genomes.","Fahlgren N, Jogdeo S, Kasschau KD, Sullivan CM, Chapman EJ, Laubinger S, Smith LM, Dasenko M, Givan SA, Weigel D, Carrington JC."],[["SRA012535"],["SRP002345","no study abstract","Summary: Small RNA sequences from Arabidopsis lyrata flowering tissues, as isolated from flowering tissues of two biological replicates.

Some miRNAs are well conserved among different plant lineages, whereas others are less conserved, and it is not clear whether less-conserved miRNAs have the same functionality as the well conserved ones. p4-siRNAs are broadly produced in the Arabidopsis genome, sometimes from active hot spot loci, but it is unknown whether individual p4-siRNA hot spots are retained as hot spots between plant species. In this study, we compare small RNAs in two closely related species (Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata) and find that less-conserved miRNAs have high rates of divergence in MIRNA hairpin structures, mature miRNA sequences, and target-complementary sites in the other species. The fidelity of miRNA biogenesis from many less-conserved MIRNA hairpins frequently deteriorates in the sister species relative to the species of first discovery. We also observe that p4-siRNA occupied loci have a slight tendency to be retained as p4-siRNA loci between species, but the most active A. lyrata p4-siRNA hot spots are generally not syntenic to the most active p4-siRNA hot spots of A. thaliana. Altogether, our findings indicate that many MIRNAs and most p4-siRNA hot spots are rapidly changing and evolutionarily transient within the Arabidopsis genus.","Ma Z, Coruh C, Axtell MJ."],[["SRA008164"],["SRP000609","none provided","none provided"],[["SRX002783","Transcriptional start site analysis","none provided","SRS002119"]],[["SRS002119","no sample description",["no sample attributes"]]],[["SRR013809","SRX002783"],["SRR013810","SRX002783"],["SRR013811","SRX002783"],["SRR013812","SRX002783"],["SRR013813","SRX002783"],["SRR013814","SRX002783"],["SRR013815","SRX002783"],["SRR013816","SRX002783"],["SRR013817","SRX002783"],["SRR013818","SRX002783"],["SRR013819","SRX002783"]],"20400770","Characterization of transcription start sites of putative non-coding RNAs by multifaceted use of massively paralleled sequencer.","DNA Res","2010","On the basis of integrated transcriptome analysis, we show that not all transcriptional start site clusters (TSCs) in the intergenic regions (iTSCs) have the same properties; thus, it is possible to discriminate the iTSCs that are likely to have biological relevance from the other noise-level iTSCs.

We quantified DNA methylation in 17 eukaryotic genomes and found that gene body methylation is conserved between plants and animals, whereas selective methylation of transposons is not. We show that methylation of plant transposons in the CHG context extends to green algae and that exclusion of histone H2A.Z from methylated DNA is conserved between plants and animals, and we present evidence for RNA-directed DNA methylation of fungal genes. Our data demonstrate that extant DNA methylation systems are mosaics of conserved and derived features, and indicate that gene body methylation is an ancient property of eukaryotic genomes.","Zemach A, McDaniel IE, Silva P, Zilberman D."],[["SRA012487"],["SRP002317","no study abstract","Summary: C.elegans small RNAs from HA::ALG-1, HA::ALG-2 and HA::RDE-1 IP and rde-1 mutants\nOverall Design: Small RNAs were cloned from transgenic or mutant C. elegans adults.

A distinction has been made between endogenous RNAi-related pathways and the exogenous RNAi pathway, the latter being essential for the experimental use of RNAi. Previous studies have shown that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, a complex containing the enzymes Dicer and the Argonaute RDE-1 process dsRNA. Dicer is responsible for cleaving dsRNA into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) while RDE-1 acts as the siRNA acceptor. RDE-1 then guides a multi-protein complex to homologous targets to trigger mRNA destabilization. However, endogenous role(s) for RDE-1, if any, have remained unexplored. We here show that RDE-1 functions as a scavenger protein, taking up small RNA molecules from many different sources, including the microRNA (miRNA) pathway. This is in striking contrast to Argonaute proteins functioning directly in the miRNA pathway, ALG-1 and ALG-2: these proteins exclusively bind miRNAs. While playing no significant role in the biogenesis of the main pool of miRNAs, RDE-1 binds endogenous miRNAs and triggers RdRP activity on at least one perfectly matching, endogenous miRNA target. The resulting secondary siRNAs are taken up by a set of Argonaute proteins known to act as siRNA acceptors in exogenous RNAi, resulting in strong mRNA destabilization. Our results show that RDE-1 in an endogenous setting is actively screening the transcriptome using many different small RNAs, including miRNAs, as a guide, with implications for the evolution of transcripts with a potential to be recognized by Dicer.","Corrêa RL, Steiner FA, Berezikov E, Ketting RF."],[["SRA017689"],["SRP002487","no study abstract","Summary: We applied 4-thiouridine to cultured cells expressing the FLAG/HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) followed by UV 365 nm irradiation.

proteins (RBPs) and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) expressed in a cell-type dependent fashion. We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions. The precise mapping of binding sites across the transcriptome will be critical to the interpretation of the rapidly emerging data on genetic variation between individuals and how these variations contribute to complex genetic diseases.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here we investigate transcription of fragments longer than 200 nucleotides, focusing on antisense transcription for known protein coding genes and intergenic transcription. We find that roughly 12% to 16% of all reads that originate from promoter and terminator regions, respectively, map antisense to the gene in question. Furthermore, we detect a high number of novel transcriptionally active regions (TARs) that are generally expressed at a lower level than protein coding genes. We find that the correlation between RNA-seq data and microarray data is dependent on the gene length, with longer genes showing a better correlation. We detect high antisense transcriptional activity from promoter, terminator and intron regions of protein-coding genes and identify a vast number of previously unidentified TARs, including putative novel EGFR transcripts. This shows that in-depth analysis of the transcriptome using RNA-seq is a valuable tool for understanding complex transcriptional events. Furthermore, the development of new algorithms for estimation of gene expression from RNA-seq data is necessary to minimize length bias.","Klevebring D, Bjursell M, Emanuelsson O, Lundeberg J."],[["SRA010763"],["SRP001690","Massively parallel pyrosequencing of polyadenylated RNA fractions of A. castellanii cells infected by mimivirus at various time during the infection.","Massively parallel pyrosequencing of RNA fractions of A. castellanii cells infected by mimivirus. Besides validating the previously annotated Mimivirus genes, this first application of deep mRNA sequencing to a large DNA virus revealed 75 new transcripts including a number of non-coding RNAs. Mimivirus genes were found to be expressed across a wide dynamic range, in a finely regulated manner broadly described by 3 main temporal classes. The precise delineation of the 5' and 3' extremities of Mimivirus mRNAs confirmed the role of the AAAATTGA sequence as an early promoter element, as well as the presence of palindromes at most of the polyadenylation sites. In addition, it pointed out a new promoter element correlating with late gene expression, that is also prominent in Sputnik Virophage.

The Mimivirus genome encodes close to 1000 proteins, many of them never before encountered in a virus, such as four amino-acyl tRNA synthetases. To explore the physiology of this exceptional virus and identify the genes involved in the building of its characteristic intracytoplasmic \"virion factory,\" we coupled electron microscopy observations with the massively parallel pyrosequencing of the polyadenylated RNA fractions of Acanthamoeba castellanii cells at various time post-infection. We generated 633,346 reads, of which 322,904 correspond to Mimivirus transcripts. This first application of deep mRNA sequencing (454 Life Sciences [Roche] FLX) to a large DNA virus allowed the precise delineation of the 5' and 3' extremities of Mimivirus mRNAs and revealed 75 new transcripts including several noncoding RNAs. Mimivirus genes are expressed across a wide dynamic range, in a finely regulated manner broadly described by three main temporal classes: early, intermediate, and late. This RNA-seq study confirmed the AAAATTGA sequence as an early promoter element, as well as the presence of palindromes at most of the polyadenylation sites. It also revealed a new promoter element correlating with late gene expression, which is also prominent in Sputnik, the recently described Mimivirus \"virophage.\" These results-validated genome-wide by the hybridization of total RNA extracted from infected Acanthamoeba cells on a tiling array (Agilent)--will constitute the foundation on which to build subsequent functional studies of the Mimivirus/Acanthamoeba system.","Legendre M, Audic S, Poirot O, Hingamp P, Seltzer V, Byrne D, Lartigue A, Lescot M, Bernadac A, Poulain J, Abergel C, Claverie JM."],[["SRA012315"],["SRP002175","no study abstract","Summary: MicroRNAs are 18-23 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence specific manner.

We examined genome-wide differences in transcription factor (TF) binding in several humans and a single chimpanzee by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. The binding sites of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and a key regulator of immune responses, nuclear factor kappaB (p65), were mapped in 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines, and 25 and 7.5% of the respective binding regions were found to differ between individuals. Binding differences were frequently associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants, and these differences were often correlated with differences in gene expression, suggesting functional consequences of binding variation. Furthermore, comparing PolII binding between humans and chimpanzee suggests extensive divergence in TF binding. Our results indicate that many differences in individuals and species occur at the level of TF binding, and they provide insight into the genetic events responsible for these differences.","Kasowski M, Grubert F, Heffelfinger C, Hariharan M, Asabere A, Waszak SM, Habegger L, Rozowsky J, Shi M, Urban AE, Hong MY, Karczewski KJ, Huber W, Weissman SM, Gerstein MB, Korbel JO, Snyder M."],[["SRA012251"],["SRP002128","no study abstract","Summary: We examined genome-wide variation in transcription factor binding in different individuals and a chimpanzee using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively-parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq).

We examined genome-wide differences in transcription factor (TF) binding in several humans and a single chimpanzee by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. The binding sites of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and a key regulator of immune responses, nuclear factor kappaB (p65), were mapped in 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines, and 25 and 7.5% of the respective binding regions were found to differ between individuals. Binding differences were frequently associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants, and these differences were often correlated with differences in gene expression, suggesting functional consequences of binding variation. Furthermore, comparing PolII binding between humans and chimpanzee suggests extensive divergence in TF binding.

Undifferentiated hESCs as well as cells at three stages of early neural differentiation, N1 (early initiation), N2 (neural progenitor), and N3 (early glial-like) were analyzed using a combination of single read, paired-end read, and long read RNA sequencing. The results revealed enormous complexity in gene transcription and splicing dynamics during neural cell differentiation. We found previously unannotated transcripts and spliced isoforms specific for each stage of differentiation. Interestingly, splicing isoform diversity is highest in undifferentiated hESCs and decreases upon differentiation, a phenomenon we call “isoform specialization.” During neural differentiation, we observed differential expression of many types of genes including those involved in key signaling pathways, and a large number of extracellular receptors exhibit stage-specific regulation. These results provide a valuable resource for studying neural differentiation and reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying in vitro neural differentiation of hESCs, such as neural fate specification, NPC identity maintenance and the transition from a predominantly neuronal state into one with increased gliogenic potential\nOverall Design: Characterization of changes in the transcriptome profiles during early stages of human neural differentiation from H1 hESCs. 454 SFF files are missing."],[["SRX017367","no description for experiment design","Solexa sequencing: mRNA was fragmented using 10X Fragmentation Buffer (Ambion) and double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II (invitrogen) reverse transcriptase and random primers.

Undifferentiated hESCs as well as cells at three stages of early neural differentiation-N1 (early initiation), N2 (neural progenitor), and N3 (early glial-like)-were analyzed using a combination of single read, paired-end read, and long read RNA sequencing. The results revealed enormous complexity in gene transcription and splicing dynamics during neural cell differentiation. We found previously unannotated transcripts and spliced isoforms specific for each stage of differentiation. Interestingly, splicing isoform diversity is highest in undifferentiated hESCs and decreases upon differentiation, a phenomenon we call isoform specialization. During neural differentiation, we observed differential expression of many types of genes, including those involved in key signaling pathways, and a large number of extracellular receptors exhibit stage-specific regulation. These results provide a valuable resource for studying neural differentiation and reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying in vitro neural differentiation of hESCs, such as neural fate specification, neural progenitor cell identity maintenance, and the transition from a predominantly neuronal state into one with increased gliogenic potential.","Wu JQ, Habegger L, Noisa P, Szekely A, Qiu C, Hutchison S, Raha D, Egholm M, Lin H, Weissman S, Cui W, Gerstein M, Snyder M."],[["SRA010967"],["SRP001851","In this study the transcriptome of a chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line has been sequenced using the Illumina mRNAseq protocol.

Here, we demonstrate that expression profiling in organisms lacking any genome or transcriptome sequence information is feasible by combining Illumina's mRNA-seq technology with a novel bioinformatics pipeline that integrates assembled and annotated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) sequences with information derived from related organisms. We applied this pipeline to the analysis of CHO cells which were chosen as a model system owing to its relevance in the production of therapeutic proteins. Specifically, we analysed CHO cells undergoing butyrate treatment which is known to affect cell cycle regulation and to increase the specific productivity of recombinant proteins. By this means, we identified sequences for >13,000 CHO genes which added sequence information of approximately 5000 novel genes to the CHO model. More than 6000 transcript sequences are predicted to be complete, as they covered >95% of the corresponding mouse orthologs. Detailed analysis of selected biological functions such as DNA replication and cell cycle control, demonstrated the potential of NGS expression profiling in organisms without extended genome sequence to improve both data quantity and quality.","Birzele F, Schaub J, Rust W, Clemens C, Baum P, Kaufmann H, Weith A, Schulz TW, Hildebrandt T."],[["SRA012038"],["SRP002009","no study abstract","Summary: RNA-Seq was applied to oral squamous cell carcinomas and matched normal oral tissue to measure gene expression patterns and identify examples of allelic imbalance.\nOverall Design: Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) and matched normal tissue from 3 patients."],[["SRX017073","no description for experiment design","SOLiD whole transcriptome (WT) protocol with total RNA extracted using Qiagen RNAeasy Mini Kit.

The sequencing of transcripts (RNA-Seq) should offer several advantages over microarray-based methods, including the ability to detect somatic mutations and accurately measure allele-specific expression. To investigate these advantages we have applied a novel, strand-specific RNA-Seq method to tumors and matched normal tissue from three patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas. Additionally, to better understand the genomic determinants of the gene expression changes observed, we have sequenced the tumor and normal genomes of one of these patients. We demonstrate here that our RNA-Seq method accurately measures allelic imbalance and that measurement on the genome-wide scale yields novel insights into cancer etiology. As expected, the set of genes differentially expressed in the tumors is enriched for cell adhesion and differentiation functions, but, unexpectedly, the set of allelically imbalanced genes is also enriched for these same cancer-related functions. By comparing the transcriptomic perturbations observed in one patient to his underlying normal and tumor genomes, we find that allelic imbalance in the tumor is associated with copy number mutations and that copy number mutations are, in turn, strongly associated with changes in transcript abundance. These results support a model in which allele-specific deletions and duplications drive allele-specific changes in gene expression in the developing tumor.","Tuch BB, Laborde RR, Xu X, Gu J, Chung CB, Monighetti CK, Stanley SJ, Olsen KD, Kasperbauer JL, Moore EJ, Broomer AJ, Tan R, Brzoska PM, Muller MW, Siddiqui AS, Asmann YW, Sun Y, Kuersten S, Barker MA, De La Vega FM, Smith DI."],[["SRA010153"],["SRP001847","A study to evaluate the effect of flowcell and library preparation on the results of transcriptome sequencing using the Illumina Genome Analyzer.

Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data.We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection.Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results.

Sporulation in Physarum can be experimentally induced by several external factors, and Physarum displays many biochemical features typical for metazoan cells, including metazoan-type signaling pathways, which makes this organism a model to study cell cycle, cell differentiation and cellular reprogramming.In order to identify the genes associated to the light-induced sporulation in Physarum, especially those related to signal transduction, we isolated RNA before and after photoinduction from sporulation- competent cells, and used these RNAs to synthesize cDNAs, which were then analyzed using the 454 sequencing technology. We obtained 16,669 cDNAs that were annotated at every computational level. 13,169 transcripts included hit count data, from which 2,772 displayed significant differential expression (upregulated: 1,623; downregulated: 1,149). Transcripts with valid annotations and significant differential expression were later integrated into putative networks using interaction information from orthologs.Gene ontology analysis suggested that most significantly downregulated genes are linked to DNA repair, cell division, inhibition of cell migration, and calcium release, while highly upregulated genes were involved in cell death, cell polarization, maintenance of integrity, and differentiation. In addition, cell death- associated transcripts were overrepresented between the upregulated transcripts. These changes are associated to a network of actin-binding proteins encoded by genes that are differentially regulated before and after light induction.","Barrantes I, Glockner G, Meyer S, Marwan W."],[["SRA011056"],["SRP001891","no study abstract","Summary: RNAseIII ribonucleases act at the heart of RNA silencing pathways by processing precursor RNAs into mature microRNAs and siRNAs. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, siRNAs are generated by the RNAseIII enzyme Dcr1 and are required for heterochromatin formation. In this study, we have analyzed the subcellular localization of Dcr1 and found that it accumulates in the nucleus and is enriched at the nuclear periphery. Nuclear accumulation of Dcr1 depends on a short motif which constrains nuclear export promoted by the double-stranded RNA binding domain of Dcr1. Absence of this motif renders Dcr1 mainly cytoplasmic and is accompanied by remarkable changes in gene expression and failure to assemble heterochromatin. Our findings suggest that dicer proteins are shuttling proteins and that the steady-state subcellular levels can be shifted towards either compartment.

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, siRNAs are generated by the RNaseIII enzyme Dcr1 and are required for heterochromatin formation at centromeres. In this study, we have analyzed the subcellular localization of Dcr1 and found that it accumulates in the nucleus and is enriched at the nuclear periphery. Nuclear accumulation of Dcr1 depends on a short motif that impedes nuclear export promoted by the double-stranded RNA binding domain of Dcr1. Absence of this motif renders Dcr1 mainly cytoplasmic and is accompanied by remarkable changes in gene expression and failure to assemble heterochromatin. Our findings suggest that Dicer proteins are shuttling proteins and that the steady-state subcellular levels can be shifted toward either compartment.(c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: cDNAs of E. sagittatum are sequenced using 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing technology. The raw reads are cleaned and assembled into a total of 76,459 consensus sequences comprising of 17,231 contigs and 59,228 singlets.

In many organisms, including plants, fungi and nematodes, cellular RNAdependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) utilize AGO targets as templates for amplification of silencing signals. Here, we show that distinct RdRPs function sequentially to produce small RNAs that target endogenous loci in C. elegans. We show that DCR-1, the RdRP RRF-3, and the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4, are required for the biogenesis of 26nt RNAs, termed 26GRNAs, and that 26G-RNAs engage the Piwi-clade AGO, ERGO-1.

Full-length enriched (FL) cDNA libraries were generated using the SMART method (Zhu et al., 2001). cDNA (5-7 ug in a 50 µL volume) was mixed with 750 uL of Illumina nebulization buffer and fragmented for 7 min in a nebulizer (Invitrogen) using compressed nitrogen at 35 psi. The sheared cDNA was purified using “QIAquick PCR Purification Kit” (Qiagen) and eluted into 32 uL of water. For the randomly primed (RP) cDNA libraries the first cDNA strand was synthesized using 1 ug of poly(A) mRNA essentially free of rRNA, random hexamer primers (300 ng per each ug of RNA), and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen). The second strand of cDNA was synthesized using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) by combining 20 uL of the 1st strand reaction, 8 uL of 10x Klenow Buffer (NEB), 1 unit of RNAse H (Invitrogen), 68.8 uL of water and 30 units of DNA Polymerase I (NEB). The reaction was incubated for 90 min at 15C and cDNA was purified using “Qiaquick PCR clean up” kit. To prepare cDNAs for sequencing on the Illumina Genome Analyzer, FL or RP cDNA (30 uL) was combined with 10 uL of 10 mM ATP in 5X T4 DNA ligase buffer (Invitrogen), 4 uL of 10 mM dNTPs mix, 2.5 uL of T4 DNA polymerase (3 U/uL), 1 uL of Klenow DNA Pol (5 U/uL) and 2.5 uL of T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 U/uL, NEB). After incubation for 30 min at 20C the DNA was purified using “QIAquick PCR Purification kit”. To add dA to the termini, 32 uL DNA from the prior step was mixed with 5 uL of 10X Klenow buffer, 10 uL of 1 mM dATP, and 3 ul of Klenow exo-polymerase (3’ to 5’ exo minus, 5 U/uL, NEB) and incubated for 30 min at 37C. DNA was purified using a “QIAquick MinElute Reaction Clean-up” (Qiagen) kit and eluted into 12 uL of water. To ligate Illumina adapters, 10 uL of cDNA from the prior step was mixed with 5 uL of 5X T4 DNA ligase buffer, 6 uL of adapter oligo mix, 4 uL of T4 DNA ligase (NEB) and incubated for 15 min at 25C. DNA was purified using a “QIAquick MinElute PCR Purification Kit”. cDNA was size-fractionated (typically with average fragment length of 170 base pairs) on 3.5% (w/v) “NuSieve GTG” agarose. The fractionated libraries were PCR amplified using “Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity” DNA polymerase (NEB) and the following PCR protocol: 30 sec at 98C, then 10 sec at 98C, 30 sec. at 65C, and 30 sec. at 72C for 18 cycles, followed by a 10-min extension step at 72C. Prior to cluster generation, DNA was diluted to a final concentration of 5 to 10 pM to generate 25,000 to 40,000 clusters per tile of the flow cell.","SRS004101"],["SRX006682","n/a","Seedlings were grown on MS agar plates at 21*C in long-days (16:8 hrs. day/night; light intensity of 130 *mol m-2s-1).

The main limitation of this approach is that examples from both classes are required which might be infeasible in certain cases, especially those dealing with biological data. Such is the case for membrane-binding peripheral domains that play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking by reversibly binding to membranes. For these domains, a well-defined positive set is available with domains known to bind membrane along with a large unlabeled set of domains whose membrane binding affinities have not been measured. The aforementioned limitation can be addressed by a special class of semi-supervised machine learning called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning that uses a positive set with a large unlabeled set. METHODS In this study, we implement the first application of PU-learning to a protein function prediction problem: identification of peripheral domains. PU-learning starts by identifying reliable negative (RN) examples iteratively from the unlabeled set until convergence and builds a classifier using the positive and the final RN set. A data set of 232 positive cases and ~3750 unlabeled ones were used to construct and validate the protocol.Holdout evaluation of the protocol on a left-out positive set showed that the accuracy of prediction reached up to 95% during two independent implementations.These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains. Protocols like the one presented here become particularly useful in the case of availability of information from one class only.","Bhardwaj N, Gerstein M, Lu H."],[["SRA000286"],["SRP000568","no study abstract","Transcriptome sequencing of wildtype Arabidopsis plants (Col-0), and met1, drm1 drm2 cmt3, and ros1 dml2 dml3 null mutants using the Illumina Genetic Analyzer."],[["SRX002554","no description for experiment design","RNA-seq library construction protocol: Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with DNaseI (Qiagen) for 30 min at room temperature. following ethanol precipitation the 18S and 28S rRNA molecules were depleted from 20 �g of total RNA in three sequential Ribominus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) reactions as per manufacturer's instructions, using 6 plant-specific biotinylated LNA oligonucleotide rRNA probes supplied by (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

The main limitation of this approach is that examples from both classes are required which might be infeasible in certain cases, especially those dealing with biological data. Such is the case for membrane-binding peripheral domains that play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking by reversibly binding to membranes. For these domains, a well-defined positive set is available with domains known to bind membrane along with a large unlabeled set of domains whose membrane binding affinities have not been measured. The aforementioned limitation can be addressed by a special class of semi-supervised machine learning called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning that uses a positive set with a large unlabeled set. METHODS In this study, we implement the first application of PU-learning to a protein function prediction problem: identification of peripheral domains. PU-learning starts by identifying reliable negative (RN) examples iteratively from the unlabeled set until convergence and builds a classifier using the positive and the final RN set. A data set of 232 positive cases and ~3750 unlabeled ones were used to construct and validate the protocol.Holdout evaluation of the protocol on a left-out positive set showed that the accuracy of prediction reached up to 95% during two independent implementations.These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains. Protocols like the one presented here become particularly useful in the case of availability of information from one class only.","Bhardwaj N, Gerstein M, Lu H."],[["SRA009962"],["SRP001320","We have carried out a global transcriptional analysis of berry development in Vitis vinifera cv.

epigenetic and transcriptional trends among two rice subspecies and their reciprocal hybrids.","Plant Cell","2010-Jan","The behavior of transcriptomes and epigenomes in hybrids of heterotic parents is of fundamental interest. Here, we report highly integrated maps of the epigenome, mRNA, and small RNA transcriptomes of two rice (Oryza sativa) subspecies and their reciprocal hybrids. We found that gene activity was correlated with DNA methylation and both active and repressive histone modifications in transcribed regions. Differential epigenetic modifications correlated with changes in transcript levels among hybrids and parental lines. Distinct patterns in gene expression and epigenetic modifications in reciprocal hybrids were observed. Through analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms from our sequence data, we observed a high correlation of allelic bias of epigenetic modifications or gene expression in reciprocal hybrids with their differences in the parental lines. The abundance of distinct small RNA size classes differed between the parents, and more small RNAs were downregulated than upregulated in the reciprocal hybrids. Together, our data reveal a comprehensive overview of transcriptional and epigenetic trends in heterotic rice crosses and provide a useful resource for the rice community.","He G, Zhu X, Elling AA, Chen L, Wang X, Guo L, Liang M, He H, Zhang H, Chen F, Qi Y, Chen R, Deng XW."],[["SRA010149"],["SRP001441","Developing T cells face a series of cell fate choices in the thymus and in the periphery. The role of the individual T cell receptor (TCR) in determining decisions of cell fate remains unresolved. The stochastic/selection model postulates that the initial fate of the cell is independent of TCR specificity, with survival dependent on additional TCR/coreceptor “rescue” signals. The “instructive” model holds that cell fate is initiated by the interaction of the TCR with a cognate peptide-MHC complex. T cells are then segregated on the basis of TCR specificity with the aid of critical co-receptors and signal modulators(1). The former would predict a random representation of individual TCR across divergent T cell lineages whereas the latter would predict minimal overlap between divergent T cell subsets. To address this issue, we have used high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the TCR distribution among key T cell developmental and effector subsets from a single donor. We found numerous examples of individual subsets sharing identical TCR sequence, supporting a model of a stochastic process of cell fate determination coupled with dynamic patterns of clonal expansion T cells bearing the same TCR sequence among both CD4 and CD8 populations.","no study description"],[["SRX013200","no description for experiment design","T cell isolations were performed using superparamagnetic polystyrene beads (Miltenyi) coated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the particular T cell subset.From whole blood, mononuclear cells were obtained by Ficoll Prep, followed by anti-CD14 microbeads to remove monocytes.

CD4+ T cells were isolated by positive selection with anti-CD4 beads. Anti-CD25 beads (Miltenyi Biotec) were used to select CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.  From the CD4+CD25- flow through, anti-CD56 beads was used to remove CD4+CD56+ NKT cells. From the CD4+CD56-flow through, anti-CD294 beads was added to select CD4+CD25-CD294+ Th2 cells and the flow through CD4+CD25-CD294- were collected as Th1 cells.Isolated CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells according to the protocols listed above were pooled together, and anti-CD45RA microbeads were added to isolate a combined population of CD45RA+ naive and transitional T cells (Tn+t).  Anti-CD45RO beads were added to the CD45RA- pass-through to select for CD45RA-RO+ memory T cells. Anti-CD69 microbeads were added to the flow-through CD45RA-RO- cells to isolate CD45RA-RO-CD69+ activated T cells. All isolated cell populations were immediately re-suspended in RNAprotect reagent (Qiagen). RNA extraction was performed using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 5000 x g, the supernatent was removed, and the cell pellet was loosened by flicking the tube. 350 μl of Buffer RLT Plus, containing β-mercaptoethanol, was added, and the pellet was dissolved completely by vortexing. The sample was homogenized by adding the sample to a QIAShredder column and centrifuging for 2 minutes. The homogenized lysate was transferred to a gDNA eliminator spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000rpm for 30 seconds. The column was discarded and the flow-through was saved. 350 μl of 70% ethanol were added to the flow-through. Samples were mixed by pipetting. 700μl of sample was transferred to an RNeasy spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tune. The sample was centrifuged for 15 seconds at 10,000 rpms.The flow-through was discarded. 700μl of Buffer RW1 were added to the spin column. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpms for 15 sec, and the flow-through was discarded. 500μ of Buffer RPE were added to the spin column. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpms for 15 seconds. The flow-through was discarded. 500 μl of Buffer RPE were added to the spin column. The sample was centrifuged for 2 minutes at 10,000 rpms. The spin column was placed in a new 2 ml collection tube. The sample was centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 rpms. The spin column was placed in a new 1.5 ml collection tube. 30μl of RNase-free water was added. The sample was centrifuged for 1 min. at 10,000 rpm. The concentration of isolated RNA was measured using Nanodrop technology. Samples were stored at -80°C.For each targets, a set of nested sequence specific primer were designed (Forward-out, Fo; Forward-in, Fi; Reverse-out, Ro; and Reverse-in, Ri). A pair of common sequence tags was linked to all internal primers (Fi and Ri). Once these tag sequences were incorporated into PCR products in the first few amplification cycles, an exponential phase of the amplification could be carried out with a pair of communal primers, called superprimers, which can pair with the tag sequences. In the first round of amplification, only sequence-specific nested primers were used. The nested primers were then removed by exonuclease and the first-round PCR products were used as templates for a second round of amplification by adding communal primers and a mixture of fresh enzyme and dNTP.","SRS007448"]],[["SRS007441","Human pan T cell receptor repertoire a/b cDNA sequences covering CDR3 regions",["no sample attributes"]],["SRS007442","Human pan T cell receptor repertoire a/b cDNA sequences covering CDR3 regions sample 2",["no sample attributes"]],["SRS007443","Human pan T cell receptor a/b repertoire sample 3",["no sample attributes"]],["SRS007444","human regular T cell receptor a/b repertoire",["no sample attributes"]],["SRS007445","human helper T cell 1 (Th1) receptor a/b repertoire",["no sample attributes"]],["SRS007446","human helper T cell 2 (Th2) receptor a/b repertoire",["no sample attributes"]],["SRS007447","human Cytotoxic T cell (Tc) receptor a/b repertoire",["no sample attributes"]],["SRS007448","human naive T cell (Tn) receptor a/b receptor",["no sample attributes"]],["SRS007449","human activated T cell (Ta) receptor a/b repertoire",["no sample attributes"]],["SRS007450","human memory T cell (Tm) receptor a/b repertoire",["no sample attributes"]]],[["SRR030416","SRX013200"],["SRR030417","SRX013201"],["SRR030702","SRX013285"],["SRR030703","SRX013284"],["SRR030704","SRX013283"],["SRR030705","SRX013280"],["SRR030706","SRX013282"],["SRR030707","SRX013281"],["SRR030708","SRX013279"],["SRR030709","SRX013206"]],"20080641","High throughput sequencing reveals a complex pattern of dynamic interrelationships among human T cell subsets.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","2010-Jan-26","Developing T cells face a series of cell fate choices in the thymus and in the periphery. The role of the individual T cell receptor (TCR) in determining decisions of cell fate remains unresolved. The stochastic/selection model postulates that the initial fate of the cell is independent of TCR specificity, with survival dependent on additional TCR/coreceptor \"rescue\" signals. The \"instructive\" model holds that cell fate is initiated by the interaction of the TCR with a cognate peptide-MHC complex. T cells are then segregated on the basis of TCR specificity with the aid of critical coreceptors and signal modulators [Chan S, Correia-Neves M, Benoist C, Mathis (1998) Immunol Rev 165: 195-207]. The former would predict a random representation of individual TCR across divergent T cell lineages whereas the latter would predict minimal overlap between divergent T cell subsets. To address this issue, we have used high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the TCR distribution among key T cell developmental and effector subsets from a single donor. We found numerous examples of individual subsets sharing identical TCR sequence, supporting a model of a stochastic process of cell fate determination coupled with dynamic patterns of clonal expansion of T cells bearing the same TCR sequence among both CD4(+) and CD8+ populations.","Wang C, Sanders CM, Yang Q, Schroeder HW Jr, Wang E, Babrzadeh F, Gharizadeh B, Myers RM, Hudson JR Jr, Davis RW, Han J."],[["SRA010237"],["SRP001532","Assembling the tree of life is a major goal of biology, but progress has been hindered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining the orthologous DNA required for accurate and fully resolved phylogenies.

In fission yeast, RNAi is tightly coupled to template transcription and chromatin modifications that establish heterochromatin in cis. Exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers seem to induce heterochromatin formation in trans only when certain silencing proteins are overexpressed. Here, we show that green fluorescent protein (GFP) hairpin dsRNA allows production of high levels of Argonaute-associated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which can induce heterochromatin formation at a remote locus. This silencing does not require any manipulation apart from hairpin expression. In cells expressing a ura4(+)-GFP fusion gene, production of GFP siRNAs causes the appearance of ura4 siRNAs from the target gene. Production of these secondary siRNAs depends on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Rdp1 (RDRP(Rdp1)) function and other RNAi pathway components. This demonstrates that transitivity occurs in fission yeast and implies that RDRP(Rdp1) can synthesize RNA from targeted RNA templates in vivo, generating siRNAs not homologous to the hairpin.","Simmer F, Buscaino A, Kos-Braun IC, Kagansky A, Boukaba A, Urano T, Kerr AR, Allshire RC."],[["SRA003623"],["SRP000424","Monitoring developmental gene expression during adult female reproduction and to examine their physiological role during adult tick blood feeding and reproduction.","Ticks are important vectors of numerous pathogens that impact human and animal health.

Here we show that tudor-domain containing 9 (Tdrd9) is essential for silencing Line-1 retrotransposon in the mouse male germline. Tdrd9 encodes an ATPase/DExH-type helicase, and its mutation causes male sterility showing meiotic failure. In Tdrd9 mutants, Line-1 was highly activated and piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) corresponding to Line-1 were increased, suggesting that feedforward amplification operates in the mutant. In fetal testes, Tdrd9 mutation causes Line-1 desilencing and an aberrant piRNA profile in prospermatogonia, followed by cognate DNA demethylation. TDRD9 complexes with MIWI2 with distinct compartmentalization in processing bodies, and this TDRD9-MIWI2 localization is regulated by MILI and TDRD1 residing at intermitochondrial cement. Our results identify TDRD9 as a functional partner of MIWI2 and indicate that the tudor-piwi association is a conserved feature, while two separate axes, TDRD9-MIWI2 and TDRD1-MILI, cooperate nonredundantly in the piwi-small RNA pathway in the mouse male germline.2009 Elsevier Inc.

The stationary phase stress response transcriptome, including many sigmaB-dependent genes, was defined for the human bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with the Illumina Genome Analyzer. Specifically, bacterial transcriptomes were compared between stationary phase cells of L. monocytogenes 10403S and an otherwise isogenic DeltasigB mutant, which does not express the alternative sigma factor sigmaB, a major regulator of genes contributing to stress response, including stresses encountered upon entry into stationary phase.Overall, 83% of all L. monocytogenes genes were transcribed in stationary phase cells; 42% of currently annotated L. monocytogenes genes showed medium to high transcript levels under these conditions. A total of 96 genes had significantly higher transcript levels in 10403S than in DeltasigB, indicating sigmaB-dependent transcription of these genes. RNA-Seq analyses indicate that a total of 67 noncoding RNA molecules (ncRNAs) are transcribed in stationary phase L. monocytogenes, including 7 previously unrecognized putative ncRNAs. Application of a dynamically trained Hidden Markov Model, in combination with RNA-Seq data, identified 65 putative sigmaB promoters upstream of 82 of the 96 sigmaB-dependent genes and upstream of the one sigmaB-dependent ncRNA. The RNA-Seq data also enabled annotation of putative operons as well as visualization of 5'- and 3'-UTR regions.The results from these studies provide powerful evidence that RNA-Seq data combined with appropriate bioinformatics tools allow quantitative characterization of prokaryotic transcriptomes, thus providing exciting new strategies for exploring transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria.","Oliver HF, Orsi RH, Ponnala L, Keich U, Wang W, Sun Q, Cartinhour SW, Filiatrault MJ, Wiedmann M, Boor KJ."],[["SRA002047"],["SRP000268","no study abstract","no study description"],[["SRX001121","no description for experiment design","cDNAs samples were synthesized with the following adaptors:  (5%u2019SMART original)  5'- AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG - 3'  (CDS-first)         5'-  TAGAGACCGAGGCGGCCGACATGTTTTGTTTTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTTT  -3'","SRS000871"],["SRX001529","no description for experiment design","cDNAs samples were synthesized with the following adaptors:  (5%u2019SMART original)  5'- AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG - 3'  (CDS-first)         5'-  TAGAGACCGAGGCGGCCGACATGTTTTGTTTTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTTT  -3'","SRS001170"],["SRX001530","no description for experiment design","cDNAs samples were synthesized with the following adaptors:  (5%u2019SMART original)  5'- AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG - 3'  (CDS-first)         5'-  TAGAGACCGAGGCGGCCGACATGTTTTGTTTTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTTT  -3'","SRS001171"],["SRX001531","no description for experiment design","cDNAs samples were synthesized with the following adaptors:  (5%u2019SMART original)  5'- AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG - 3'  (CDS-first)         5'-  TAGAGACCGAGGCGGCCGACATGTTTTGTTTTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTTT  -3'","SRS001172"],["SRX001885","no description for experiment design","cDNAs samples were synthesized with the following adaptors:  (5%u2019-SMART-TT) 5' -AAG CAG TGG TAT CAA CGC AGA GTG GCC ATT ACG GCC TTG GG-3' (CDS second)  5'- TAG AGG CCG AGG CGG CCG ACA TGT TTT GTC TTT TGT TCT GTT TCT TTT -3'","SRS001172"]],[["SRS000871","We sampled a variety of different life stages of Rhagoletis pomonella ranging from larvae to adults.

Here we report the first large expressed sequence tag (EST) study of a candidate for ecological sympatric speciation, the apple maggot Rhagoletis pomonella, using massively parallel pyrosequencing on the Roche 454-FLX platform. To maximize transcript diversity we created and sequenced separate libraries from larvae, pupae, adult heads, and headless adult bodies.We obtained 239,531 sequences which assembled into 24,373 contigs. A total of 6810 unique protein coding genes were identified among the contigs and long singletons, corresponding to 48% of all known Drosophila melanogaster protein-coding genes. Their distribution across GO classes suggests that we have obtained a representative sample of the transcriptome. Among these sequences are many candidates for potential R. pomonella \"speciation genes\" (or \"barrier genes\") such as those controlling chemosensory and life-history timing processes. Furthermore, we identified important marker loci including more than 40,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and over 100 microsatellites. An initial search for SNPs at which the apple and hawthorn host races differ suggested at least 75 loci warranting further work. We also determined that developmental expression differences remained even after normalization; transcripts expected to show different expression levels between larvae and pupae in D. melanogaster also did so in R. pomonella. Preliminary comparative analysis of transcript presences and absences revealed evidence of gene loss in Drosophila and gain in the higher dipteran clade Schizophora.These data provide a much needed resource for exploring mechanisms of divergence in this important model for sympatric ecological speciation. Our description of ESTs from a substantial portion of the R. pomonella transcriptome will facilitate future functional studies of candidate genes for olfaction and diapause-related life history timing, and will enable large scale expression studies. Similarly, the identification of new SNP and microsatellite markers will facilitate future population and quantitative genetic studies of divergence between the apple and hawthorn-infesting host races.","Schwarz D, Robertson HM, Feder JL, Varala K, Hudson ME, Ragland GJ, Hahn DA, Berlocher SH."],[["SRA010773"],["SRP001701","no study abstract","Summary: We deep-sequenced small RNAs after immunoprecipitation of Mili or Miwi, as well as total small RNA from adult mouse testis.

Based on analysis of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome, promising gene candidates for biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides was identified, and the suitability of Z. filipendulae as a model system for cyanogenesis in insects is evident.","Zagrobelny M, Scheibye-Alsing K, Jensen NB, Møller BL, Gorodkin J, Bak S."],[["SRA010068"],["SRP001390","Nucleosome positioning around the gene space (or transcriptional unit) plays a crucial role for gene regulation but we do not know if the spatial organization-nucleosome-space occupancy or nucleosome density in a defined sequence unit length-contributes to the regulation complexity of mammalian gene expression.

MiRNAs participate in the regulation of myogenesis, and identification of the complete set of miRNAs expressed in muscles is likely to significantly increase our understanding of muscle growth and development. To determine the identity and abundance of miRNA in porcine skeletal muscle, we applied a deep sequencing approach. This allowed us to identify the sequences and relative expression levels of 212 annotated miRNA genes, thereby providing a thorough account of the miRNA transcriptome in porcine muscle tissue. The expression levels displayed a very large range, as reflected by the number of sequence reads, which varied from single counts for rare miRNAs to several million reads for the most abundant miRNAs. Moreover, we identified numerous examples of mature miRNAs that were derived from opposite sides of the same predicted precursor stem-loop structures, and also observed length and sequence heterogeneity at the 5' and 3' ends. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis suggested that highly expressed miRNAs are involved in skeletal muscle development and regeneration, signal transduction, cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix communication and neural development and function.\nOverall Design: Examination of small RNA profiles in 7 isolates of porcine muscleThe raw sequences were trimmed to 30 nucleotides, and it was set as a requirement that any sequence must appear at least three times and be present in at least two of the seven libraries. All identical reads within a library were grouped and converted into unique sequences. Reads containing Ns or long tracks (����8) of As were removed and the sequences were trimmed for adaptor-sequences. To annotate the unique sequences, a Decypher Tera-BLASTN Search was performed against a database of mature miRNAs obtained from miRBase (release 12.0). Hits with a match of 16 or more nucleotides to a miRNA from the database were gathered, and the count of each miRNA was normalized to the total number of sequence reads per lane.

The expression levels displayed a very large range, as reflected by the number of sequence reads, which varied from single counts for rare miRNAs to several million reads for the most abundant miRNAs. Moreover, we identified numerous examples of mature miRNAs that were derived from opposite sides of the same predicted precursor stem-loop structures, and also observed length and sequence heterogeneity at the 5' and 3' ends. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis suggested that highly expressed miRNAs are involved in skeletal muscle development and regeneration, signal transduction, cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix communication and neural development and function.","Nielsen M, Hansen JH, Hedegaard J, Nielsen RO, Panitz F, Bendixen C, Thomsen B."],[["SRA010264"],["SRP001554","no study abstract","Summary: microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small silencing RNAs that have regulatory roles in gene expression. miRNAs interact with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to form effector complexes that can cleave target mRNAs or repress their translation.

We applied massive parallel 454 pyrosequencing technology to a normalized cDNA extract and unveiled potential candidate genes for all steps of secondary metabolite pathways (phenylpropanoids and terpenoids).

Here we investigate the impact of SNP variation on the reliability of read-mapping in the context of detecting allele-specific expression (ASE).We generated sixteen million 35 bp reads from mRNA of each of two HapMap Yoruba individuals.  When we mapped these reads to the human genome we found that, at heterozygous SNPs, there was a significant bias towards higher mapping rates of the allele in the reference sequence, compared to the alternative allele.  Masking known SNP positions in the genome sequence eliminated the reference bias but, surprisingly, did not lead to more reliable results overall. We find that even after masking, $\\sim$5-10\\% of SNPs still have an inherent bias towards more effective mapping of one allele. Filtering out inherently biased SNPs removes 40\\% of the top signals of ASE.

However, a major technical hurdle lies in the need to map short sequence reads back to their correct locations in a reference genome. Here, we investigate the impact of SNP variation on the reliability of read-mapping in the context of detecting allele-specific expression (ASE).We generated 16 million 35 bp reads from mRNA of each of two HapMap Yoruba individuals. When we mapped these reads to the human genome we found that, at heterozygous SNPs, there was a significant bias toward higher mapping rates of the allele in the reference sequence, compared with the alternative allele. Masking known SNP positions in the genome sequence eliminated the reference bias but, surprisingly, did not lead to more reliable results overall. We find that even after masking, approximately 5-10% of SNPs still have an inherent bias toward more effective mapping of one allele. Filtering out inherently biased SNPs removes 40% of the top signals of ASE. The remaining SNPs showing ASE are enriched in genes previously known to harbor cis-regulatory variation or known to show uniparental imprinting. Our results have implications for a variety of applications involving detection of alternate alleles from short-read sequence data.Scripts, written in Perl and R, for simulating short reads, masking SNP variation in a reference genome and analyzing the simulation output are available upon request from JFD.

The variation in editing give receptors like the Htr2c and the GABAA a different set of protein isoforms during the development than in the adult animal. Further we show that this regulation on editing activity cannot be explained by an altered expression of the ADAR proteins rather the presence of a regulatory network that controls the editing activity during the development.","no study description"],[["SRX012264","PCR products were amplified using primers specific for the known A-to-I editing substrates in Table 1 and the FastStart High Fidelity PCR System (Roche).

The family of ADAR enzymes converts some adenosines of RNA duplexes to inosines through hydrolytic deamination. The adenosine recognition mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, to investigate it, we analyzed a set of selectively edited substrates with a cluster of edited sites. We used a large set of individual transcripts sequenced by the 454 sequencing technique. On average, we analyzed 570 single transcripts per edited region at four different developmental stages from embryogenesis to adulthood. To our knowledge, this is the first time, large-scale sequencing has been used to determine synchronous editing events. We demonstrate that edited sites are only coupled within specific distances from each other. Furthermore, our results show that the coupled sites of editing are positioned on the same side of a helix, indicating that the three-dimensional structure is key in ADAR enzyme substrate recognition. Finally, we propose that editing by the ADAR enzymes is initiated by their attraction to one principal site in the substrate.","Ensterö M, Daniel C, Wahlstedt H, Major F, Ohman M."],[["SRA001150"],["SRP000228","The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched a public research consortium named ENCODE, the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements, in September 2003, to carry out a project to identify all functional elements in the human genome sequence.

We compared simulation results for traditional capillary sequencing with \"Next Generation\" (NG) ultra high-throughput technologies. The simulation model was parameterized using mappings of 130,000 cDNA sequence reads to the Arabidopsis genome (NCBI Accession SRA008180.19). We also generated 454-GS20 sequences and de novo assemblies for the basal eudicot California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) and the magnoliid avocado (Persea americana) using a variety of methods for cDNA synthesis.The Arabidopsis reads tagged more than 15,000 genes, including new splice variants and extended UTR regions. Of the total 134,791 reads (13.8 MB), 119,518 (88.7%) mapped exactly to known exons, while 1,117 (0.8%) mapped to introns, 11,524 (8.6%) spanned annotated intron/exon boundaries, and 3,066 (2.3%) extended beyond the end of annotated UTRs. Sequence-based inference of relative gene expression levels correlated significantly with microarray data. As expected, NG sequencing of normalized libraries tagged more genes than non-normalized libraries, although non-normalized libraries yielded more full-length cDNA sequences. The Arabidopsis data were used to simulate additional rounds of NG and traditional EST sequencing, and various combinations of each. Our simulations suggest a combination of FLX and Solexa sequencing for optimal transcriptome coverage at modest cost. We have also developed ESTcalc http://fgp.huck.psu.edu/NG_Sims/ngsim.pl, an online webtool, which allows users to explore the results of this study by specifying individualized costs and sequencing characteristics.NG sequencing technologies are a highly flexible set of platforms that can be scaled to suit different project goals. In terms of sequence coverage alone, the NG sequencing is a dramatic advance over capillary-based sequencing, but NG sequencing also presents significant challenges in assembly and sequence accuracy due to short read lengths, method-specific sequencing errors, and the absence of physical clones. These problems may be overcome by hybrid sequencing strategies using a mixture of sequencing methodologies, by new assemblers, and by sequencing more deeply. Sequencing and microarray outcomes from multiple experiments suggest that our simulator will be useful for guiding NG transcriptome sequencing projects in a wide range of organisms.","Wall PK, Leebens-Mack J, Chanderbali AS, Barakat A, Wolcott E, Liang H, Landherr L, Tomsho LP, Hu Y, Carlson JE, Ma H, Schuster SC, Soltis DE, Soltis PS, Altman N, dePamphilis CW."],[["SRA007807"],["SRP000456","no study abstract","no study description"],[["SRX002161","no description for experiment design","no description for experiment library construction","SRS001915"]],[["SRS001915","Pool of mRNA extracted from Zoarces viviparus catched along the Swedish west-coast.

From 400,000 reads generated by massively parallel pyrosequencing, more than 50,000 pieces of putative transcripts were assembled, annotated and functionally classified.

This approach could be very valuable for complex plant genomes. In addition, little emphasis has been given to efforts aiming at an estimation of the overall transcriptional universe found in a multicellular organism at a specific developmental stage.To explore, in depth, the transcriptional diversity in an ancient maize landrace, we developed a protocol to optimize the sequencing of cDNAs and performed 4 consecutive GS20-454 pyrosequencing runs of a cDNA library obtained from 2 week-old Palomero Toluqueño maize plants. The protocol reported here allowed obtaining over 90% of informative sequences. These GS20-454 runs generated over 1.5 Million reads, representing the largest amount of sequences reported from a single plant cDNA library. A collection of 367,391 quality-filtered reads (30.09 Mb) from a single run was sufficient to identify transcripts corresponding to 34% of public maize ESTs databases; total sequences generated after 4 filtered runs increased this coverage to 50%. Comparisons of all 1.5 Million reads to the Maize Assembled Genomic Islands (MAGIs) provided evidence for the transcriptional activity of 11% of MAGIs. We estimate that 5.67% (86,069 sequences) do not align with public ESTs or annotated genes, potentially representing new maize transcripts. Following the assembly of 74.4% of the reads in 65,493 contigs, real-time PCR of selected genes confirmed a predicted correlation between the abundance of GS20-454 sequences and corresponding levels of gene expression.A protocol was developed that significantly increases the number, length and quality of cDNA reads using massive 454 parallel sequencing. We show that recurrent 454 pyrosequencing of a single cDNA sample is necessary to attain a thorough representation of the transcriptional universe present in maize, that can also be used to estimate transcript abundance of specific genes. This data suggests that the molecular and functional diversity contained in the vast native landraces remains to be explored, and that large-scale transcriptional sequencing of a presumed ancestor of the modern maize varieties represents a valuable approach to characterize the functional diversity of maize for future agricultural and evolutionary studies.","Vega-Arreguín JC, Ibarra-Laclette E, Jiménez-Moraila B, Martínez O, Vielle-Calzada JP, Herrera-Estrella L, Herrera-Estrella A."],[["SRA003647"],["SRP000614","Transcriptome sequencing using next-generation sequencing platforms will soon be competing with DNA microarray technologies for global gene expression analysis.

To facilitate genomics studies in corals and other non-model systems, we describe methods for transcriptome sequencing using 454, as well as strategies for assembling a useful catalog of genes from the output. We have applied these methods to sequence the transcriptome of planulae larvae from the coral Acropora millepora.More than 600,000 reads produced in a single 454 sequencing run were assembled into approximately 40,000 contigs with five-fold average sequencing coverage. Based on sequence similarity with known proteins, these analyses identified approximately 11,000 different genes expressed in a range of conditions including thermal stress and settlement induction. Assembled sequences were annotated with gene names, conserved domains, and Gene Ontology terms. Targeted searches using these annotations identified the majority of genes associated with essential metabolic pathways and conserved signaling pathways, as well as novel candidate genes for stress-related processes. Comparisons with the genome of the anemone Nematostella vectensis revealed approximately 8,500 pairs of orthologs and approximately 100 candidate coral-specific genes.

This chestnut blight is caused by Cryphonectria parasitica, a fungus that infects stem tissues and kills the trees by girdling them. Because of the great economic and ecological value of this species, significant efforts have been made over the century to combat this disease, but it wasn't until recently that a focused genomics approach was initiated. Prior to the Genomic Tool Development for the Fagaceae project, genomic resources available in public databases for this species were limited to a few hundred ESTs. To identify genes involved in resistance to C. parasitica, we have sequenced the transcriptome from fungal infected and healthy stem tissues collected from blight-sensitive American chestnut and blight-resistant Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) trees using ultra high throughput pyrosequencing. RESULTS: We produced over a million 454 reads, totaling over 250 million bp, from which we generated 40,039 and 28,890 unigenes in total from C. mollissima and C. dentata respectively. The functions of the unigenes, from GO annotation, cover a diverse set of molecular functions and biological processes, among which we identified a large number of genes associated with resistance to stresses and response to biotic stimuli. In silico expression analyses showed that many of the stress response unigenes were expressed more in canker tissues versus healthy stem tissues in both American and Chinese chestnut. Comparative analysis also identified genes belonging to different pathways of plant defense against biotic stresses that are differentially expressed in either American or Chinese chestnut canker tissues. CONCLUSION: Our study resulted in the identification of a large set of cDNA unigenes from American chestnut and Chinese chestnut. The ESTs and unigenes from this study constitute an important resource to the scientific community interested in the discovery of genes involved in various biological processes in Chestnut and other species. The identification of many defense-related genes differentially expressed in canker vs. healthy stem in chestnuts provides many new candidate genes for developing resistance to the chestnut blight and for studying pathways involved in responses of trees to necrotrophic pathogens. We also identified several candidate genes that may underline the difference in resistance to Cryphonectria parasitica between American chestnut and Chinese chestnut.","Barakat A, DiLoreto DS, Zhang Y, Smith C, Baier K, Powell WA, Wheeler N, Sederoff R, Carlson JE."],[["SRA008134"],["SRP000652","14 zebrafish immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoires were sequenced.

We report genomic landscapes of representative epigenetic modifications and their relationships to mRNA and small RNA (smRNA) transcriptomes in maize shoots and roots. The epigenetic patterns differed dramatically between genes and transposable elements, and two repressive marks (H3K27me3 and DNA methylation) were usually mutually exclusive. We found an organ-specific distribution of canonical microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), indicative of their tissue-specific biogenesis. Furthermore, we observed that a decreasing level of mop1 led to a concomitant decrease of 24-nucleotide siRNAs relative to 21-nucleotide miRNAs in a tissue-specific manner. A group of 22-nucleotide siRNAs may originate from long-hairpin double-stranded RNAs and preferentially target gene-coding regions. Additionally, a class of miRNA-like smRNAs, whose putative precursors can form short hairpins, potentially targets genes in trans.

We applied this method to observe gene-expression changes in a colon cancer cell line cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We generated more than 100 million 36-base TSS-tag sequences and revealed comprehensive features of hypoxia responsive alterations in the transcriptional landscape of the human genome. The features include presence of inducible 'hot regions' in 54 genomic regions, 220 novel hypoxia inducible promoters that may drive non-protein-coding transcripts, 191 hypoxia responsive alternative promoters and detailed views of 120 novel as well as known hypoxia responsive genes. We further analyzed hypoxic response of different cells using additional 60 million TSS-tags and found that the degree of the gene-expression changes were different among cell lines, possibly reflecting cellular robustness against hypoxia. The novel dynamic figure of the human gene transcriptome will deepen our understanding of the transcriptional program of the human genome as well as bringing new insights into the biology of cancer cells in hypoxia.","Tsuchihara K, Suzuki Y, Wakaguri H, Irie T, Tanimoto K, Hashimoto S, Matsushima K, Mizushima-Sugano J, Yamashita R, Nakai K, Bentley D, Esumi H, Sugano S."],[["SRA008252"],["SRP000637","no study abstract","Here we present a strategy based on deep sequencing of ribosome protected mRNA fragments that enables high precision genome-wide investigation of translation with sub-codon resolution.

For example, the total number of confirmed splice junctions was raised from 70,911 to over 98,000. The data also suggest thousands of modifications to WormBase annotations and identify new spliced junctions and genes not part of any WormBase annotation, including at least 80 putative genes not found in any of three predicted gene sets. The quantitative nature of the data also suggests that mRNA levels may be measured by this approach with unparalleled precision.

Individual non-coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein-coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure. Deep sequencing of small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE (cap-analysis of gene expression) tags, which mark the 5' ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter-associated small RNAs, appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and non-coding genes, sometimes crossing exon-exon junctions. Here we show that processing of mature mRNAs through an as yet unknown mechanism may generate complex populations of both long and short RNAs whose apparently capped 5' ends coincide. Supplying synthetic promoter-associated small RNAs corresponding to the c-MYC transcriptional start site reduced MYC messenger RNA abundance. The studies presented here expand the catalogue of cellular small RNAs and demonstrate a biological impact for at least one class of non-canonical small RNAs.","Affymetrix ENCODE Transcriptome Project; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ENCODE Transcriptome Project."],[["SRA000267"],["SRP000532","no study abstract","Hornsh*j H, Bendixen E, Conley LN, Andersen PK, Hedegaard J, Panitz F and Bendixen C: Positive correlation between transcript and protein heart-muscle expression ratios in pig obtained by 454-sequencing and iTRAQ-based proteomics in a comparative study with cDNA microarray (2007, unpublished).

Until now, such studies of have only included microarray or short length sequence tags for transcript profiling. Furthermore, most comparisons of transcript and protein levels have been based on absolute expression values from within the same tissue and not relative expression values based on tissue ratios.Presented here is a novel study of two porcine tissues based on integrative analysis of data from expression profiling of identical samples using cDNA microarray, 454-sequencing and iTRAQ-based proteomics. Sequence homology identified 2.541 unique transcripts that are detectable by both microarray hybridizations and 454-sequencing of 1.2 million cDNA tags. Both transcript-based technologies showed high reproducibility between sample replicates of the same tissue, but the correlation across these two technologies was modest. Thousands of genes being differentially expressed were identified with microarray. Out of the 306 differentially expressed genes, identified by 454-sequencing, 198 (65%) were also found by microarray. The relationship between the regulation of transcript and protein levels was analyzed by integrating iTRAQ-based proteomics data. Protein expression ratios were determined for 354 genes, of which 148 could be mapped to both microarray and 454-sequencing data. A comparison of the expression ratios from the three technologies revealed that differences in transcript and protein levels across heart and muscle tissues are positively correlated.We show that the reproducibility within cDNA microarray and 454-sequencing is high, but that the agreement across these two technologies is modest. We demonstrate that the regulation of transcript and protein levels across identical tissue samples is positively correlated when the tissue expression ratios are used for comparison. The results presented are of interest in systems biology research in terms of integration and analysis of high-throughput expression data from mammalian tissues.","Hornshøj H, Bendixen E, Conley LN, Andersen PK, Hedegaard J, Panitz F, Bendixen C."],[["SRA008249"],["SRP000634","no study abstract","We report the comprehensive sequencing of small RNA libraries created from different developmental stages of the basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis.

A typical miRNA gene produces a predominant approximately 21-nucleotide (nt) RNA (the miRNA) along with a less abundant miRNA(*) product. We sought to identify miRNAs from the simple chordate Ciona intestinalis through comprehensive sequencing of small RNA libraries created from different developmental stages. Unexpectedly, half of the identified miRNA loci encode up to four distinct, stable small RNAs. The additional RNAs, miRNA-offset RNAs (moRs), are generated from sequences immediately adjacent to the predicted approximately 60-nt pre-miRNA. moRs seem to be produced by RNAse III-like processing, are approximately 20 nt long and, like miRNAs, are observed at specific developmental stages.

We identified 50 conserved microRNA families by similarity searching against miRBase, and a maximum of 185 potential locust-specific microRNA family candidates were identified using our newly developed method independent of locust genome sequence. We also demonstrate conservation of microRNA*, and evolutionary analysis of locust microRNAs indicates that the generation of miRNAs in locusts is concentrated along three phylogenetic tree branches: bilaterians, coelomates, and insects. Our study identified thousands of endogenous small interfering RNAs, some of which were of transposon origin, and also detected many Piwi-interacting RNA-like small RNAs. Comparison of small RNA expression patterns of the two phases showed that longer small RNAs were expressed more abundantly in the solitary phase and that each category of small RNAs exhibited different expression profiles between the two phases.The abundance of small RNAs in the locust might indicate a long evolutionary history of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, and differential expression of small RNAs between the two phases might further disclose the molecular mechanism of phase changes.","Wei Y, Chen S, Yang P, Ma Z, Kang L."],[["SRA010034"],["SRP001370","no study abstract","Summary: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a conserved class of small non-coding RNAs that are found in all higher eukaryotes as well as some DNA viruses. MiRNAs are 20-25 nucleotides (nt) in length and have important regulatory functions in biological processes such as embryonic development, cell differentiation, hormone secretion or metabolism. Furthermore, miRNAs have been implicated in the pathology of various diseases including cancer. MiRNA expression profiles not only classify different types of cancer but also may even help to characterize distinct tumor stages, therefore constituting a valuable tool for prognosis. Here we report the miRNA profile of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tissue samples characterized by cloning and sequencing. We find that all EBV miRNAs from the BART region are expressed in NPC tissues whereas ebv-miRNAs from the BHRF1 region are not found. Moreover, we identify two novel EBV miRNA genes originating from the BART region that have not been found in other tissues or cell lines before. We also identify three new human miRNAs, which might be specific for nasopharyngeal tissues. We further show that a number of different cellular miRNAs are upor down-regulated in NPC tissues compared to control tissue including miR-15a and miR-16. We find that the tumor suppressor BRCA-1 is a target of miR-15a as well as miR-16 suggesting a miRNA role in NPC pathogenesis.\nOverall Design: 2 pairs of NPC and control tissues from 2 patients (4 samples in total) were examined."],[["SRX012421","no description for experiment design","From all samples, RNA species smaller than 200 bases were enriched with the mirVana  miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA).

We describe the development of a 5'-end transcriptome workflow for the SOLiD system and demonstrate the advantages in sensitivity and dynamic range offered by this tag-based application over traditional approaches for the study of whole genome gene expression. 5'-end transcriptome analysis was used to study whole genome gene expression within a colon cancer cell line, HT-29, treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5Aza). More than 20 million 25-base 5'-end tags were obtained from untreated and 5Aza-treated cells and matched to sequences within the human genome. Seventy three percent of the mapped unique tags were associated with RefSeq cDNA sequences, corresponding to approximately 14,000 different protein-coding genes in this single cell type. The level of expression of these genes ranged from 0.02 to 4,704 transcripts per cell. The sensitivity of a single sequence run of the SOLiD platform was 100-1,000 fold greater than that observed from 5'end SAGE data generated from the analysis of 70,000 tags obtained by Sanger sequencing. The high-resolution 5'end gene expression profiling presented in this study will not only provide novel insight into the transcriptional machinery but should also serve as a basis for a better understanding of cell biology.","Hashimoto S, Qu W, Ahsan B, Ogoshi K, Sasaki A, Nakatani Y, Lee Y, Ogawa M, Ametani A, Suzuki Y, Sugano S, Lee CC, Nutter RC, Morishita S, Matsushima K."],[["SRA008247"],["SRP000632","no study abstract","A complete description of the transcriptome of an organism is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how it functions, how its transcriptional networks are controlled, and may provide insights into the organism�s evolution.  Despite the status of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as arguably the most well studied model eukaryote, we still do not have a full catalog or understanding of all its genes.  In order to interrogate the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae for low abundance or rapidly turned over transcripts, we deleted elements of the RNA degradation machinery with the goal of preferentially increasing the relative abundance of such transcripts.  We then used high-resolution tiling microarrays and ultra high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) to identify, map and validate unannotated transcripts that are more abundant in the RNA degradation mutants relative to wild-type cells.  We identified 365 currently unannotated transcripts, the majority presumably representing low abundance or short-lived RNAs, of which 185 are previously unknown and unique to this study.  It is likely that many of these are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), which are rapidly degraded and whose function(s) within the cell are still unclear, while others may be novel functional transcripts.  Of the 185 transcripts we identified as novel to our study, greater than 80 percent come from regions of the genome that have lower conservation scores amongst closely related yeast species than 85 percent of the verified ORFs in S. cerevisiae.  Such regions of the genome have typically been less well studied, and by definition transcripts from these regions will distinguish S. cerevisiae from these closely related species. Four samples, a wild-type reference and three mutants (1 containing 4 deletions and the other two containing 3 each), were subjected to high salt shock, and total RNA was harvested.

Despite the status of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as arguably the most well-studied model eukaryote, we still do not have a full catalog or understanding of all its genes. In order to interrogate the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae for low abundance or rapidly turned over transcripts, we deleted elements of the RNA degradation machinery with the goal of preferentially increasing the relative abundance of such transcripts. We then used high-resolution tiling microarrays and ultra high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) to identify, map, and validate unannotated transcripts that are more abundant in the RNA degradation mutants relative to wild-type cells. We identified 365 currently unannotated transcripts, the majority presumably representing low abundance or short-lived RNAs, of which 185 are previously unknown and unique to this study. It is likely that many of these are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), which are rapidly degraded and whose function(s) within the cell are still unclear, while others may be novel functional transcripts. Of the 185 transcripts we identified as novel to our study, greater than 80 percent come from regions of the genome that have lower conservation scores amongst closely related yeast species than 85 percent of the verified ORFs in S. cerevisiae. Such regions of the genome have typically been less well-studied, and by definition transcripts from these regions will distinguish S. cerevisiae from these closely related species.","Lee A, Hansen KD, Bullard J, Dudoit S, Sherlock G."],[["SRA008246"],["SRP000631","no study abstract","Medicago truncatula endogenous small RNAs.

Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86% with a minor isoform frequency of 15% or more.

We examined the construction of the piRNA system in the restricted developmental window in which methylation patterns are set during mammalian embryogenesis. We find robust expression of two Piwi family proteins, MIWI2 and MILI. Their associated piRNA profiles reveal differences from Drosophila wherein large piRNA clusters act as master regulators of silencing. Instead, in mammals, dispersed transposon copies initiate the pathway, producing primary piRNAs, which predominantly join MILI in the cytoplasm.

Here we examined the construction of the piRNA system in the restricted developmental window in which methylation patterns are set during mammalian embryogenesis. We find robust expression of two Piwi family proteins, MIWI2 and MILI. Their associated piRNA profiles reveal differences from Drosophila wherein large piRNA clusters act as master regulators of silencing. Instead, in mammals, dispersed transposon copies initiate the pathway, producing primary piRNAs, which predominantly join MILI in the cytoplasm. MIWI2, whose nuclear localization and association with piRNAs depend upon MILI, is enriched for secondary piRNAs antisense to the elements that it controls. The Piwi pathway lies upstream of known mediators of DNA methylation, since piRNAs are still produced in dnmt3L mutants, which fail to methylate transposons.

In addition to miRNAs, other bilaterian small RNAs, known as Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), protect the genome from transposons. Here we identify small RNAs from animal phyla that diverged before the emergence of the Bilateria. The cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (starlet sea anemone), a close relative to the Bilateria, possesses an extensive repertoire of miRNA genes, two classes of piRNAs and a complement of proteins specific to small-RNA biology comparable to that of humans. The poriferan Amphimedon queenslandica (sponge), one of the simplest animals and a distant relative of the Bilateria, also possesses miRNAs, both classes of piRNAs and a full complement of the small-RNA machinery. Animal miRNA evolution seems to have been relatively dynamic, with precursor sizes and mature miRNA sequences differing greatly between poriferans, cnidarians and bilaterians. Nonetheless, miRNAs and piRNAs have been available as classes of riboregulators to shape gene expression throughout the evolution and radiation of animal phyla.","Grimson A, Srivastava M, Fahey B, Woodcroft BJ, Chiang HR, King N, Degnan BM, Rokhsar DS, Bartel DP."],[["SRA009450"],["SRP001121","no study abstract","miRNA sequencing from murine embryonic stem cells (mES, v6.5), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), murine neural precursor cells (NPC), and ZHBT-c4 cells (from Austin Smith) untreated (0h), with 12 hours of doxycyclin treatment (12h), and with 24 hours of doxycyclin treatment (24h)."],[["SRX008325","no description for experiment design","Single-stranded cDNA libraries of short transcripts were generated using size selected RNA.

We describe here the transcriptional regulatory circuitry of ES cells that incorporates protein-coding and miRNA genes based on high-resolution ChIP-seq data, systematic identification of miRNA promoters, and quantitative sequencing of short transcripts in multiple cell types. We find that the key ES cell transcription factors are associated with promoters for miRNAs that are preferentially expressed in ES cells and with promoters for a set of silent miRNA genes. This silent set of miRNA genes is co-occupied by Polycomb group proteins in ES cells and shows tissue-specific expression in differentiated cells. These data reveal how key ES cell transcription factors promote the ES cell miRNA expression program and integrate miRNAs into the regulatory circuitry controlling ES cell identity.","Marson A, Levine SS, Cole MF, Frampton GM, Brambrink T, Johnstone S, Guenther MG, Johnston WK, Wernig M, Newman J, Calabrese JM, Dennis LM, Volkert TL, Gupta S, Love J, Hannett N, Sharp PA, Bartel DP, Jaenisch R, Young RA."],[["SRA025072"],["SRP003878","no study abstract","Summary: To examine the effects of microRNAs including miR-223 on murine neutrophil function, small RNAs cloning and sequencing from neutrophils were performed.\nOverall Design: Neutrophils were isolated from a wild-type mouse and total RNAs were prepared.

MicroRNAs are known to influence the evolution and stability of many mRNAs, but their global impact on protein output had not been examined. Here we use quantitative mass spectrometry to measure the response of thousands of proteins after introducing microRNAs into cultured cells and after deleting mir-223 in mouse neutrophils. The identities of the responsive proteins indicate that targeting is primarily through seed-matched sites located within favourable predicted contexts in 3' untranslated regions. Hundreds of genes were directly repressed, albeit each to a modest degree, by individual microRNAs. Although some targets were repressed without detectable changes in mRNA levels, those translationally repressed by more than a third also displayed detectable mRNA destabilization, and, for the more highly repressed targets, mRNA destabilization usually comprised the major component of repression.

To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from arrays, using the same RNA samples. We show that the sequencing data are highly replicable, with remarkably little technical variation. Indeed, our analyses suggest it may be sufficient to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane) to accurately estimate gene expression levels. Moreover, our data suggests that Solexa sequencing is comparable, if not superior, to arrays in facilitating the identiffication of differ­entially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol as well as a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra high-throughput sequencing technology.

A major system that controls the activity of transposable elements (TEs) in flies and vertebrates is mediated by Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which are approximately 24-30 nucleotide RNAs that are bound by Piwi-class effectors. The piRNA system is thought to provide primarily a germline defense against TE activity.Here, we describe a second system that represses Drosophila TEs by using endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are 21 nucleotide, 3'-end-modified RNAs that are dependent on Dicer-2 and Argonaute-2. In contrast to piRNAs, we find that the TE-siRNA system is active in somatic tissues, and particularly so in various immortalized cell lines. Analysis of the patterns and properties of TE-derived small RNAs reveals further distinctions between TE regions and genomic loci that are converted into piRNAs and siRNAs, respectively. Finally, functional tests show that many transposon transcripts accumulate to higher levels in cells and animal tissues that are deficient for Dicer-2 or Argonaute-2.Drosophila utilizes two small-RNA systems to restrict transposon activity in the germline (mostly via piRNAs) and in the soma (mostly via siRNAs).","Chung WJ, Okamura K, Martin R, Lai EC."],[["SRA008236"],["SRP000622","no study abstract","Whole genome small RNA sequencing (wild-type Col-0, abh1-1, ein5-6, ein5-6 abh1-1) and 5'-RACE (GMUCT) (wild-type Col-0 and ein5-6) sequencing of parenthetically indicated genotypes of Arabidopsis using the Illumina Genetic Analyzer.

Through the analysis of ein5 abh1 double mutant plants, we find that CBP80/ABH1 regulates the levels of mature miRNAs, which suggests this protein is a novel component of the miRNA-mediated RNA silencing pathway. Additionally, we show that a novel class of smRNAs are processed from both sense and anti-sense strands of ~130 endogenous transcripts that apparently are converted to double-stranded RNA and subsequently processed into smRNAs, and accumulate in the absence of XRN4/EIN5. Moreover, we demonstrate that accumulation of these smRNAs is often synergistically increased in ein5 abh1 double mutant plants, which suggests that these proteins act coordinately to regulate the substrates from which they are processed. Finally, we find that the parent transcripts of these novel smRNAs accumulate in an uncapped form upon loss of XRN4/EIN5. These results suggest that uncapped endogenous transcripts can shuttle into an RNA silencing pathway where they become smRNA biogenesis substrates.

Several distinct classes of small regulatory RNAs have been discovered in recent years. To extend the repertoire of small regulatory RNAs characterized in chickens we used a deep sequencing approach developed by Solexa (now Illumina Inc.). We sequenced three small RNA libraries prepared from different developmental stages of the chicken embryo (days 5, 7, and 9) to produce over 9.5 million short sequence reads. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to distinguish authentic mature miRNA sequences from other classes of small RNAs and short RNA fragments represented in the sequencing data. Using this approach we detected almost all of the previously known chicken miRNAs and their respective miRNA* sequences. In addition we discovered 449 putative new chicken miRNAs.

Several distinct classes of small regulatory RNAs have been discovered in recent years. To extend the repertoire of small regulatory RNAs characterized in chickens we used a deep sequencing approach developed by Solexa (now Illumina Inc.). We sequenced three small RNA libraries prepared from different developmental stages of the chicken embryo (days five, seven, and nine) to produce over 9.5 million short sequence reads. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to distinguish authentic mature miRNA sequences from other classes of small RNAs and short RNA fragments represented in the sequencing data. Using this approach we detected almost all of the previously known chicken miRNAs and their respective miRNA* sequences. In addition we discovered 449 new chicken miRNAs including 88 miRNA candidates. Of these, 430 miRNAs appear to be specific to the avian lineage.

This notion is based on the fact that mutants lacking the core siRNA-generating enzyme Dicer-2 or the predominant siRNA effector Argonaute 2 are viable, fertile and of relatively normal morphology. Moreover, endogenous Drosophila siRNAs have not yet been identified. Here we report that siRNAs derived from long hairpin RNA genes (hpRNAs) programme Slicer complexes that can repress endogenous target transcripts. The Drosophila hpRNA pathway is a hybrid mechanism that combines canonical RNA interference factors (Dicer-2, Hen1 (known as CG12367) and Argonaute 2) with a canonical microRNA factor (Loquacious) to generate approximately 21-nucleotide siRNAs. These novel regulatory RNAs reveal unexpected complexity in the sorting of small RNAs, and open a window onto the biological usage of endogenous RNA interference in Drosophila.","Okamura K, Chung WJ, Ruby JG, Guo H, Bartel DP, Lai EC."],[["SRA024699"],["SRP003805","no study abstract","Summary: Small RNA pathways play evolutionarily conserved roles in gene regulation and in defense from pathogenic and parasitic nucleic acids.

In flies, somatic cells produce siRNAs from exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a defense against viral infection. We identified endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs), 21 nucleotides in length, that correspond to transposons and heterochromatic sequences in the somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. We also detected endo-siRNAs complementary to messenger RNAs (mRNAs); these siRNAs disproportionately mapped to the complementary regions of overlapping mRNAs predicted to form double-stranded RNA in vivo. Normal accumulation of somatic endo-siRNAs requires the siRNA-generating ribonuclease Dicer-2 and the RNAi effector protein Argonaute2 (Ago2). We propose that endo-siRNAs generated by the fly RNAi pathway silence selfish genetic elements in the soma, much as Piwi-interacting RNAs do in the germ line.","Ghildiyal M, Seitz H, Horwich MD, Li C, Du T, Lee S, Xu J, Kittler EL, Zapp ML, Weng Z, Zamore PD."],[["SRA024695"],["SRP003801","no study abstract","Summary: \n\n\nHigh-throughput sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs.\ntotal RNA, ~18-26nt RNAs isolated using PAGE, ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH\nKeywords: High-throughput solexa sequencing\nOverall Design: Small RNAs were sequenced from D. melanogaster female head.

We report here that antisense transcription of the Hox miRNA locus mir-iab-4 generates the novel pre-miRNA hairpin mir-iab-8, which is then processed into endogenous mature miRNAs. Sense and antisense iab-4/iab-8 miRNAs are functionally distinguished by their distinct domains of expression and targeting capabilities. We find that miR-iab-8-5p, like miR-iab-4-5p, is also relevant to Hox gene regulation. Ectopic mir-iab-8 can strongly repress the Hox genes Ultrabithorax and abdominal-A via extensive arrays of conserved target sites, and can induce a dramatic homeotic transformation of halteres into wings. We generalize the antisense miRNA principle by showing that several other loci in both invertebrates and vertebrates are endogenously processed on their antisense strands into mature miRNAs with distinct seeds. These findings demonstrate that antisense transcription and processing contributes to the functional diversification of miRNA genes.","Tyler DM, Okamura K, Chung WJ, Hagen JW, Berezikov E, Hannon GJ, Lai EC."],[["SRA001014"],["SRP000182","RNA-centered meta-transcriptomic approach to simultaneously obtain information on both structure and function of a soil community.","Soil ecosystems harbor the most complex prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities on Earth. Experimental approaches studying these systems usually focus on either the soil community's taxonomic structure or its functional characteristics. Many methods target DNA as marker molecule and use PCR for amplification.   Here we apply an RNA-centered meta-transcriptomic approach to simultaneously obtain information on both structure and function of a soil community. Total community RNA is random reversely transcribed into cDNA without any PCR or cloning step. Direct pyrosequencing produces large numbers of cDNA rRNA-tags; these are taxonomically profiled in a binning approach using the MEGAN software and two specifically compiled rRNA reference databases containing small and large subunit rRNA sequences. The pyrosequencing also produces mRNA-tags; these provide a sequence-based transcriptome of the community. One soil dataset of 258,411 RNA-tags of ~98bp length contained 193,219 rRNA-tags with valid taxonomic information, together with 21,133 mRNA-tags. Quantitative information about the relative abundance of organisms from all three domains of life and from different trophic levels was obtained in a single experiment. Less frequent taxa, such as soil Crenarchaeota, were well represented in the data set. These were identified by more than 2,000 rRNA-tags; furthermore, their activity in situ was revealed through the presence of mRNA-tags specific for enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation and CO2 fixation.   This approach could be widely applied in microbial ecology by efficiently linking community structure and function in a single experiment while avoiding biases inherent in other methods."],[["SRX000330","no description for experiment design","Total nucleic acids were extracted from soil with bead beating.

The increase in nitrate availability in soils is important for plant nutrition, but it also has considerable impact on groundwater pollution owing to leaching. Here we show that archaeal ammonia oxidizers are more abundant in soils than their well-known bacterial counterparts. We investigated the abundance of the gene encoding a subunit of the key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) in 12 pristine and agricultural soils of three climatic zones. amoA gene copies of Crenarchaeota (Archaea) were up to 3,000-fold more abundant than bacterial amoA genes. High amounts of crenarchaeota-specific lipids, including crenarchaeol, correlated with the abundance of archaeal amoA gene copies. Furthermore, reverse transcription quantitative PCR studies and complementary DNA analysis using novel cloning-independent pyrosequencing technology demonstrated the activity of the archaea in situ and supported the numerical dominance of archaeal over bacterial ammonia oxidizers. Our results indicate that crenarchaeota may be the most abundant ammonia-oxidizing organisms in soil ecosystems on Earth.","Leininger S, Urich T, Schloter M, Schwark L, Qi J, Nicol GW, Prosser JI, Schuster SC, Schleper C."]]
