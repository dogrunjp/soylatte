We applied miRNA-, mRNA-, and ChIP-Seq to characterize the microRNome during lymphopoiesis within the context of the transcriptome and epigenome. We show that lymphocyte-specific miRNAs are either tightly controlled by polycomb group-mediated H3K27me3 or maintained in a semi-activated epigenetic state prior to full expression. Because of miRNA biogenesis, the cellular concentration of mature miRNAs does not typically reflect transcriptional changes. However, we uncover a subset of miRNAs for which abundance is dictated by miRNA gene expression. We confirm that concentration of 5p and 3p miRNA strands depends largely on free energy properties of miRNA duplexes. Unexpectedly, we also find that miRNA strand accumulation can be developmentally regulated.

In light of these discoveries, assessing whether novel transcription start sites (TSSs) are alternative promoters of known genes or promoters of newly identified transcripts require dedicated approaches. Furthermore, collecting such data from limiting amount of RNAs, such as microdissected cell types or from sub-cellular compartments with ex vivo samples—a necessary step to reduce the complexity of the studied transcriptome while keeping its biological relevance—often requires quantities of starting total RNA that are not sufficient for current protocols. Addressing both challenges, we developed nanoCAGE, a 5′ ends RNA profiling method of both poly-A+ and poly-A− transcripts that operates using as little as 10 ng of total RNA, coupled with CAGEscan, a technology for a gene-agnostic exploration of the transcriptome structure and dynamics, linking de novo-assembled transcripts to their regulatory regions","While the classic CAGE protocol requires a substantial number of biochemical processing steps, CAGEscan and nanoCAGE take advantage of a peculiar property of reverse transcriptase, called “template switching” to select 5′ ends of capped transcripts. This property allows proceeding directly from the first-strand cDNA synthesis to the addition of the second-strand cDNA primer at the 5′ end of the original RNA sequence without purification steps, thereby avoiding loss of material. This approach exploits the ability of the reverse-transcriptase to extend the cDNA using the mRNA’s cap as a template: the resulting neo-synthesized first strand cDNA carries one to three C nucleotides in correspondence of the cap structure. These Cs are hybridized to the ribo-G at the 3′ end of a template switching (TS) oligonucleotide. Then, the reverse transcriptase extends cDNA polymerization using the TS oligonucleotide as template, providing extra 3′ sequences to the first-strand cDNA. Due to the selectivity of the template switch for capped molecules, both protocols were used on total RNA, without depletion of ribosomal RNAs. Notably, the usage of 3′ random primer allows the detection of non-coding, non-polyadenylated RNAs. In the CAGEscan protocol, cDNAs are not cleaved, but directly prepared for sequencing by a second PCR which adds the adapter sequences needed to bridge PCR in the Illumina Genome Analyzers. In contrast with the nanoCAGE protocol, sequencing of both the 5′ end and the 3′ end of the template-switched captured cDNAs yields collections of 3′ ends reads “scanning” transcripts that can be unequivocally defined by their common 5′ end. Yet, unlike nanoCAGE libraries that contain uniformly short sequences, CAGEscan libraries are composed of sequences of broader size range including fragments longer than 1 kb, which poorly perform on currently available second-generation sequencing platform. However, since CAGEscan exclusively uses random primers at high concentration and commercial reverse transcriptases do not have a strong strand displacement activity, CAGEscan sequencing templates prepared by our optimized protocol are kept relatively short, regardless the length of the original mRNA molecules."],[["DRX000214","no description for experiment design","no description for

The volume of water was reduced to 2 microl by centrifugal evaporation at room temperature in the presence of 0.66 M D- Threalose (Nacalai Tesque), 3.3 M D-Sorbitol (WAKO), 100 microM of TS oligonucleotide TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGCA(rG)(rG)(rG), 10 microM of random RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCTN15 (Stangegaard et al., 2006) or 10 microM of polythimine RT primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT18. The oligonucleotides were added at this step because it helps to keep the final reaction volume low. They contain binding sites for the type III restriction enzyme EcoP15I (Meisel et al., 1992), indicated in bold, that will be used to extract 5' tags from the cDNAs. Trehalose and sorbitol protect RNAs against degradation and capture on tube walls by preventing the samples from drying completely. Furthermore, these poly-hydroxylated molecules thermoactivate the reverse transcriptase (RTase) at the next step (Carninci et al., 1998). The mixture was then was heat-denatured at 65 deg_C for 10 min in a thermocycler (MWG) and transferred quickly on a ice/water mixture, to avoid the formation  of  secondary  structures.  Reverse transcription and template switching were accomplished together in a volume of 10 microl with the following components: 1.25 x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 650 nM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 1.3 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 925 mM betaine (Spiess and Ivell, 2002) (WAKO) , and 200 units of SuperScriptII (Invitrogen). The reactions were incubated at 22 deg_C for 10 min, 50 deg_C for 30 min, 75 deg_C for 15 min in a thermocycler., and then immediately transferred on a ice/water mix. To prepare the second strand synthesis and amplification of the cDNAs, a small scale semi-suppressive PCR reaction was performed to evaluate the optimal number of cycles, defined as the last cycle before the intensity of the product ceases to increase. 10 microl aliquots were taken every two cycles and analyzed on 1% agarose gel. For each cDNA preparation, 2 microl of first strand cDNA were amplified in reactions of 100 microl using a mixture containing 1 x ExTaq Buffer (TaKaRa), 200 microM dNTPs (TaKaRa), 100 nM forward PCR primer TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAGC, 100 nM reverse PCR primer primer GTACCAGCAGTAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCTCT, and 5 units of ExTaq (TaKaRa) with the following thermocycling program: 5 min 95 deg_C, n x (10 s at 95 deg_C, 15 s at 65 deg_C, 2 min at 68 deg_C) and using hot start. The rest of the cDNAs (6 microl each) were then processed in 4 reactions of 100 microl with the chosen number of cycles. PCR products were pooled and cleaned using CTAB and GE Healthcare GFX purification columns (to be published elsewhere).

However, previous approaches for sequencing cDNA clones were expensive or time-consuming, and therefore, a fast and efficient sequencing approach was demanded.We developed a program, MuSICA 2, that assembles millions of short (36-nucleotide) reads collected from a single flow cell lane of Illumina Genome Analyzer to shotgun-sequence approximately 800 human full-length cDNA clones. MuSICA 2 performs a hybrid assembly in which an external de novo assembler is run first and the result is then improved by reference alignment of shotgun reads. We compared the MuSICA 2 assembly with 200 pooled full-length cDNA clones finished independently by the conventional primer-walking using Sanger sequencers. The exon-intron structure of the coding sequence was correct for more than 95% of the clones with coding sequence annotation when we excluded cDNA clones insufficiently represented in the shotgun library due to PCR failure (42 out of 200 clones excluded), and the nucleotide-level accuracy of coding sequences of those correct clones was over 99.99%. We also applied MuSICA 2 to full-length cDNA clones from Toxoplasma gondii, to confirm that its ability was competent even for non-human species.The entire sequencing and shotgun assembly takes less than 1 week and the consumables cost only approximately US$3 per clone, demonstrating a significant advantage over previous approaches.","Kuroshu RM, Watanabe J, Sugano S, Morishita S, Suzuki Y, Kasahara M."],[["SRA017691"],["SRP002489","no study abstract","Summary: \nAndrogen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the growth and development of the normal prostate and its malignant transformation.  More recently, a majority of prostate cancers have been shown to harbor recurrent gene fusions of the androgen-regulated gene, TMPRSS2, to the oncogenic ETS transcription factor ERG.  Here we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to explore the genome-wide localization of these transcription factors in human prostate cancer cell lines as well as tissues.  Unexpectedly, transcriptional networks emanating from AR and ERG were found to be highly overlapping.  Furthermore, AR was found to regulate known 5’ fusion partners in prostate cancer including TMPRSS2, as well as negatively regulating its own expression.  While induced by androgen through fusion to TMPRSS2, ERG itself was shown to inhibit AR expression and positively regulate the genomic locus of wild-type ERG, thus revealing multiple levels of molecular cross-talk between AR and ERG.  Importantly, androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells in which ERG is overexpressed are able to proliferate and invade in the absence of androgen.  Thus, we dissected the intertwined genomic landscape of two master transcriptional regulators of prostate cancer and suggest a role for ERG in maintaining transcriptional networks necessary for androgen-independent prostate cancer growth.  These studies may suggest that future therapies against prostate cancer should target both AR and ERG, rather than AR alone, in order to achieve maximum effectiveness.\nOverall Design: ChIP_Seq examination of histone modifications and key transcription factors in LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cell lines in un-treated, vehicle treated or 10nM R1881 treated conditions.LNCaP ChIP-Seq experiments include samples GSM353609-GSM353618, GSM353625-GSM353628, GSM353633-GSM353635, GSM353641-GSM353644, and GSM353648.VCaP ChIP-Seq experiments include samples GSM353601-GSM353608, GSM353619-GSM353624, GSM353629-GSM353632, and GSM353645-GSM353647.In addition, we performed re-ChIP of AR and ERG in VCaP cells (GSM356767), and examined the effect of ERG knockdown on AR and ERG binding (samples GSM353636-GSM353639).To study ectopic ERG binding we performed ERG ChIP-Seq in stable RWPE+ERG or control cells (samples GSM353649-GSM353650).AR ChIP-Seq was also done in the AR-positive but ETS fusion-negative 22RV1 cells (GSM353640).To further study transcription factor binding and chromatin state we performed ChIP-Seq of AR, ERG, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and RNA Pol II in a metastatic prostate tumor tissue (samples GSM353651-GSM353656).To couple  the ChIP-Seq experiments with gene expression, we have also done Illumian SAGE-tag profiling in LNCaP cells following androgen treatment for 0, 24 and 48hrs. These DGE experiments correspond to samples GSM353657-GSM353659.Summary: \nAndrogen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the growth and development of the normal prostate and its malignant transformation.

Differential miRNA expression has been reported to be of functional relevance for tumor biology. Using next-generation sequencing, the unbiased and absolute quantification of the small RNA transcriptome is now feasible. Neuroblastoma(NB) is an embryonal tumor with highly variable clinical course. We analyzed the small RNA transcriptomes of five favorable and five unfavorable NBs using SOLiD next-generation sequencing, generating a total of >188 000 000 reads. MiRNA expression profiles obtained by deep sequencing correlated well with real-time PCR data. Cluster analysis differentiated between favorable and unfavorable NBs, and the miRNA transcriptomes of these two groups were significantly different. Oncogenic miRNAs of the miR17-92 cluster and the miR-181 family were overexpressed in unfavorable NBs. In contrast, the putative tumor suppressive microRNAs, miR-542-5p and miR-628, were expressed in favorable NBs and virtually absent in unfavorable NBs. In-depth sequence analysis revealed extensive post-transcriptional miRNA editing. Of 13 identified novel miRNAs, three were further analyzed, and expression could be confirmed in a cohort of 70 NBs.","Schulte JH, Marschall T, Martin M, Rosenstiel P, Mestdagh P, Schlierf S, Thor T, Vandesompele J, Eggert A, Schreiber S, Rahmann S, Schramm A."],[["DRA000005"],["DRP000005","Comprehensive identification and characterization of the transcripts, their\n            expression levels and sub-cellular localizations in mammalian genes were attempted.

all transcriptional start site clusters (TSCs) in the intergenic regions (iTSCs) have the same properties; thus, it is possible to discriminate the iTSCs that are likely to have biological relevance from the other noise-level iTSCs. We used a total of 251,933,381 short-read sequence tags generated from various types of transcriptome analyses in order to characterize 6039 iTSCs, which have significant expression levels. We analyzed and found that 23% of these iTSCs were located in the proximal regions of the RefSeq genes. These RefSeq-linked iTSCs showed similar expression patterns with the neighboring RefSeq genes, had widely fluctuating transcription start sites and lacked ordered nucleosome positioning. These iTSCs seemed not to form independent transcriptional units, simply representing the by-products of the neighboring RefSeq genes, in spite of their significant expression levels. Similar features were also observed for the TSCs located in the antisense regions of the RefSeq genes. Furthermore, for the remaining iTSCs that were not associated with any RefSeq genes, we demonstrate that integrative interpretation of the transcriptome data provides essential information to specify their biological functions in the hypoxic responses of the cells.","Sathira N, Yamashita R, Tanimoto K, Kanai A, Arauchi T, Kanematsu S, Nakai K, Suzuki Y, Sugano S."],[["SRA017689"],["SRP002487","no study abstract","Summary: We applied 4-thiouridine to cultured cells expressing the FLAG/HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) followed by UV 365 nm irradiation.

identification of RNA-binding protein and microRNA target sites by PAR-CLIP.","Cell","2010-Apr-2","RNA transcripts are subject to posttranscriptional gene regulation involving hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) expressed in a cell-type dependent fashion. We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions. The precise mapping of binding sites across the transcriptome will be critical to the interpretation of the rapidly emerging data on genetic variation between individuals and how these variations contribute to complex genetic diseases.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here we investigate transcription of fragments longer than 200 nucleotides, focusing on antisense transcription for known protein coding genes and intergenic transcription. We find that roughly 12% to 16% of all reads that originate from promoter and terminator regions, respectively, map antisense to the gene in question. Furthermore, we detect a high number of novel transcriptionally active regions (TARs) that are generally expressed at a lower level than protein coding genes. We find that the correlation between RNA-seq data and microarray data is dependent on the gene length, with longer genes showing a better correlation. We detect high antisense transcriptional activity from promoter, terminator and intron regions of protein-coding genes and identify a vast number of previously unidentified TARs, including putative novel EGFR transcripts. This shows that in-depth analysis of the transcriptome using RNA-seq is a valuable tool for understanding complex transcriptional events. Furthermore, the development of new algorithms for estimation of gene expression from RNA-seq data is necessary to minimize length bias.","Klevebring D, Bjursell M, Emanuelsson O, Lundeberg J."],[["SRA012315"],["SRP002175","no study abstract","Summary: MicroRNAs are 18-23 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence specific manner.

Undifferentiated hESCs as well as cells at three stages of early neural differentiation, N1 (early initiation), N2 (neural progenitor), and N3 (early glial-like) were analyzed using a combination of single read, paired-end read, and long read RNA sequencing. The results revealed enormous complexity in gene transcription and splicing dynamics during neural cell differentiation. We found previously unannotated transcripts and spliced isoforms specific for each stage of differentiation. Interestingly, splicing isoform diversity is highest in undifferentiated hESCs and decreases upon differentiation, a phenomenon we call “isoform specialization.” During neural differentiation, we observed differential expression of many types of genes including those involved in key signaling pathways, and a large number of extracellular receptors exhibit stage-specific regulation. These results provide a valuable resource for studying neural differentiation and reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying in vitro neural differentiation of hESCs, such as neural fate specification, NPC identity maintenance and the transition from a predominantly neuronal state into one with increased gliogenic potential\nOverall Design: Characterization of changes in the transcriptome profiles during early stages of human neural differentiation from H1 hESCs. 454 SFF files are missing."],[["SRX017367","no description for experiment design","Solexa sequencing: mRNA was fragmented using 10X Fragmentation Buffer (Ambion) and double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II (invitrogen) reverse transcriptase and random primers.

Undifferentiated hESCs as well as cells at three stages of early neural differentiation-N1 (early initiation), N2 (neural progenitor), and N3 (early glial-like)-were analyzed using a combination of single read, paired-end read, and long read RNA sequencing. The results revealed enormous complexity in gene transcription and splicing dynamics during neural cell differentiation. We found previously unannotated transcripts and spliced isoforms specific for each stage of differentiation. Interestingly, splicing isoform diversity is highest in undifferentiated hESCs and decreases upon differentiation, a phenomenon we call isoform specialization. During neural differentiation, we observed differential expression of many types of genes, including those involved in key signaling pathways, and a large number of extracellular receptors exhibit stage-specific regulation. These results provide a valuable resource for studying neural differentiation and reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying in vitro neural differentiation of hESCs, such as neural fate specification, neural progenitor cell identity maintenance, and the transition from a predominantly neuronal state into one with increased gliogenic potential.","Wu JQ, Habegger L, Noisa P, Szekely A, Qiu C, Hutchison S, Raha D, Egholm M, Lin H, Weissman S, Cui W, Gerstein M, Snyder M."],[["SRA012038"],["SRP002009","no study abstract","Summary: RNA-Seq was applied to oral squamous cell carcinomas and matched normal oral tissue to measure gene expression patterns and identify examples of allelic imbalance.\nOverall Design: Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) and matched normal tissue from 3 patients."],[["SRX017073","no description for experiment design","SOLiD whole transcriptome (WT) protocol with total RNA extracted using Qiagen RNAeasy Mini Kit.

The sequencing of transcripts (RNA-Seq) should offer several advantages over microarray-based methods, including the ability to detect somatic mutations and accurately measure allele-specific expression. To investigate these advantages we have applied a novel, strand-specific RNA-Seq method to tumors and matched normal tissue from three patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas. Additionally, to better understand the genomic determinants of the gene expression changes observed, we have sequenced the tumor and normal genomes of one of these patients. We demonstrate here that our RNA-Seq method accurately measures allelic imbalance and that measurement on the genome-wide scale yields novel insights into cancer etiology. As expected, the set of genes differentially expressed in the tumors is enriched for cell adhesion and differentiation functions, but, unexpectedly, the set of allelically imbalanced genes is also enriched for these same cancer-related functions. By comparing the transcriptomic perturbations observed in one patient to his underlying normal and tumor genomes, we find that allelic imbalance in the tumor is associated with copy number mutations and that copy number mutations are, in turn, strongly associated with changes in transcript abundance. These results support a model in which allele-specific deletions and duplications drive allele-specific changes in gene expression in the developing tumor.","Tuch BB, Laborde RR, Xu X, Gu J, Chung CB, Monighetti CK, Stanley SJ, Olsen KD, Kasperbauer JL, Moore EJ, Broomer AJ, Tan R, Brzoska PM, Muller MW, Siddiqui AS, Asmann YW, Sun Y, Kuersten S, Barker MA, De La Vega FM, Smith DI."],[["SRA010153"],["SRP001847","A study to evaluate the effect of flowcell and library preparation on the results of transcriptome sequencing using the Illumina Genome Analyzer.

We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection.Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for mRNA-Seq.","Bullard JH, Purdom E, Hansen KD, Dudoit S."],[["SRA009169"],["SRP000955","We have developed a novel method for identification of novel ncRNAs, which involves the generation of cDNA libraries from size-fractionated RNPs.

The role of the individual T cell receptor (TCR) in determining decisions of cell fate remains unresolved. The stochastic/selection model postulates that the initial fate of the cell is independent of TCR specificity, with survival dependent on additional TCR/coreceptor “rescue” signals. The “instructive” model holds that cell fate is initiated by the interaction of the TCR with a cognate peptide-MHC complex. T cells are then segregated on the basis of TCR specificity with the aid of critical co-receptors and signal modulators(1). The former would predict a random representation of individual TCR across divergent T cell lineages whereas the latter would predict minimal overlap between divergent T cell subsets. To address this issue, we have used high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the TCR distribution among key T cell developmental and effector subsets from a single donor. We found numerous examples of individual subsets sharing identical TCR sequence, supporting a model of a stochastic process of cell fate determination coupled with dynamic patterns of clonal expansion T cells bearing the same TCR sequence among both CD4 and CD8 populations.","no study description"],[["SRX013200","no description for experiment design","T cell isolations were performed using superparamagnetic polystyrene beads (Miltenyi) coated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the particular T cell subset.From whole blood, mononuclear cells were obtained by Ficoll Prep, followed by anti-CD14 microbeads to remove monocytes.

The role of the individual T cell receptor (TCR) in determining decisions of cell fate remains unresolved. The stochastic/selection model postulates that the initial fate of the cell is independent of TCR specificity, with survival dependent on additional TCR/coreceptor \"rescue\" signals. The \"instructive\" model holds that cell fate is initiated by the interaction of the TCR with a cognate peptide-MHC complex. T cells are then segregated on the basis of TCR specificity with the aid of critical coreceptors and signal modulators [Chan S, Correia-Neves M, Benoist C, Mathis (1998) Immunol Rev 165: 195-207]. The former would predict a random representation of individual TCR across divergent T cell lineages whereas the latter would predict minimal overlap between divergent T cell subsets. To address this issue, we have used high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the TCR distribution among key T cell developmental and effector subsets from a single donor. We found numerous examples of individual subsets sharing identical TCR sequence, supporting a model of a stochastic process of cell fate determination coupled with dynamic patterns of clonal expansion of T cells bearing the same TCR sequence among both CD4(+) and CD8+ populations.","Wang C, Sanders CM, Yang Q, Schroeder HW Jr, Wang E, Babrzadeh F, Gharizadeh B, Myers RM, Hudson JR Jr, Davis RW, Han J."],[["SRA010852"],["SRP001758","no study abstract","Summary: \n\n\nRecent transcriptome analysis indicates that >90% of human genes undergoes alternative splicing, underscoring the contribution of differential RNA processing to diverse proteomes in higher eukaryotic cells.

Allele-specific expression (ASE) quantifies transcription from both haplotypes using individuals heterozygous at tested SNPs. We performed deep human transcriptome-wide resequencing (RNA-seq) for ASE analysis and expression quantitative trait locus discovery. We resequenced double poly(A)-selected RNA from primary CD4(+) T cells (n = 4 individuals, both activated and untreated conditions) and developed tools for paired-end RNA-seq alignment and ASE analysis. We generated an average of 20 million uniquely mapping 45 base reads per sample. We obtained sufficient read depth to test 1371 unique transcripts for ASE. Multiple biases inflate the false discovery rate which we estimate to be approximately 50% for random SNPs. However, after controlling for these biases and considering the subset of SNPs that pass HapMap QC, 4.6% of heterozygous SNP-sample pairs show evidence of imbalance (P < 0.001). We validated four findings by both bacterial cloning and Sanger sequencing assays.

developed a simple method to collect precise positional information of transcriptional start sites (TSSs) together with digital information of the gene-expression levels in a high throughput manner. We applied this method to observe gene-expression changes in a colon cancer cell line cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We generated more than 100 million 36-base TSS-tag sequences and revealed comprehensive features of hypoxia responsive alterations in the transcriptional landscape of the human genome. The features include presence of inducible 'hot regions' in 54 genomic regions, 220 novel hypoxia inducible promoters that may drive non-protein-coding transcripts, 191 hypoxia responsive alternative promoters and detailed views of 120 novel as well as known hypoxia responsive genes. We further analyzed hypoxic response of different cells using additional 60 million TSS-tags and found that the degree of the gene-expression changes were different among cell lines, possibly reflecting cellular robustness against hypoxia. The novel dynamic figure of the human gene transcriptome will deepen our understanding of the transcriptional program of the human genome as well as bringing new insights into the biology of cancer cells in hypoxia.","Tsuchihara K, Suzuki Y, Wakaguri H, Irie T, Tanimoto K, Hashimoto S, Matsushima K, Mizushima-Sugano J, Yamashita R, Nakai K, Bentley D, Esumi H, Sugano S."],[["SRA008169"],["SRP000599","no study abstract","We report an applicaton of small RNA sequencing using high throughput next generation sequencing to identify the small RNA content of cell lines.

Individual non-coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein-coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure. Deep sequencing of small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE (cap-analysis of gene expression) tags, which mark the 5' ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter-associated small RNAs, appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and non-coding genes, sometimes crossing exon-exon junctions. Here we show that processing of mature mRNAs through an as yet unknown mechanism may generate complex populations of both long and short RNAs whose apparently capped 5' ends coincide. Supplying synthetic promoter-associated small RNAs corresponding to the c-MYC transcriptional start site reduced MYC messenger RNA abundance. The studies presented here expand the catalogue of cellular small RNAs and demonstrate a biological impact for at least one class of non-canonical small RNAs.","Affymetrix ENCODE Transcriptome Project; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ENCODE Transcriptome Project."],[["SRA010034"],["SRP001370","no study abstract","Summary: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a conserved class of small non-coding RNAs that are found in all higher eukaryotes as well as some DNA viruses.

Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common.

A global survey of messenger RNA splicing events identified 94,241 splice junctions (4096 of which were previously unidentified) and showed that exon skipping is the most prevalent form of alternative splicing.","Sultan M, Schulz MH, Richard H, Magen A, Klingenhoff A, Scherf M, Seifert M, Borodina T, Soldatov A, Parkhomchuk D, Schmidt D, O'Keeffe S, Haas S, Vingron M, Lehrach H, Yaspo ML."],[["SRA000299"],["SRP000225","Comparison of Solexa and Affy expression in two human tissues.","Ultra high-throughput sequencing has been used recently as an alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe an application of the Solexa sequencing platform to the detection and comparison of mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Solexa sequencing and to assess its ability to identify differentially expressed genes. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from arrays, using the same RNA samples. We show that the sequencing data are highly replicable, with remarkably little technical variation. Indeed, our analyses suggest it may be sufficient to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane) to accurately estimate gene expression levels. Moreover, our data suggests that Solexa sequencing is comparable, if not superior, to arrays in facilitating the identiffication of differ­entially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol as well as a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra high-throughput sequencing technology.  We extracted total RNA from liver and kidney samples of a single human male, purified the poly-A mRNA and sheared it prior to cDNA synthesis. The cDNA was then processed into a library of template molecules suitable  for sequencing on the Illumina Genome Analyzer. To assess technical variance within and between runs, we sequenced each sample seven times, split across two runs of the machine. To investigate the effects of cDNA concentration, two different cDNA concentrations were used: 3 pM (five lanes per sample) and 1.5 pM (two lanes per sample)."],[["SRX000571","Illumina sequencing human liver RNA samples to study mRNA expression levels.","This method involves several steps that are designed to convert total RNA into a library of template molecules suitable for high throughput DNA sequencing.
