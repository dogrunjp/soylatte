Identification of intron/exon boundaries is an essential part of genome annotation, yet remains a challenge. Here, we present supersplat, a method for unbiased splice-junction discovery through empirical RNA-seq data.Using a genomic reference and RNA-seq high-throughput sequencing datasets, supersplat empirically identifies potential splice junctions at a rate of approximately 11.4 million reads per hour. We further benchmark the performance of the algorithm by mapping Illumina RNA-seq reads to identify introns in the genome of the reference dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana and we demonstrate the utility of supersplat for de novo empirical annotation of splice junctions using the reference monocot plant Brachypodium distachyon.Implemented in C++, supersplat source code and binaries are freely available on the web at http://mocklerlab-tools.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/.","Bryant DW Jr, Shen R, Priest HD, Wong WK, Mockler TC."],["20407027","MicroRNA gene evolution in Arabidopsis lyrata and Arabidopsis thaliana.","Plant Cell","2010-Apr","SRA018974","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs processed from partially self-complementary foldbacks within longer MIRNA primary transcripts. Several MIRNA families are conserved deeply through land plants, but many are present only in closely related species or are species specific. The finding of numerous evolutionarily young MIRNA, many with low expression and few if any targets, supports a rapid birth-death model for MIRNA evolution. A systematic analysis of MIRNA genes and families in the close relatives, Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, was conducted using both whole-genome comparisons and high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs. Orthologs of 143 A. thaliana MIRNA genes were identified in A. lyrata, with nine having significant sequence or processing changes that likely alter function. In addition, at least 13% of MIRNA genes in each species are unique, despite their relatively recent speciation (approximately 10 million years ago). Alignment of MIRNA foldbacks to the Arabidopsis genomes revealed evidence for recent origins of 32 families by inverted or direct duplication of mostly protein-coding gene sequences, but less than half of these yield miRNA that are predicted to target transcripts from the originating gene family. miRNA nucleotide divergence between A. lyrata and A. thaliana orthologs was higher for young MIRNA genes, consistent with reduced purifying selection compared with deeply conserved MIRNA genes. Additionally, target sites of younger miRNA were lost more frequently than for deeply conserved families. In summary, our systematic analyses emphasize the dynamic nature of the MIRNA complement of plant genomes.","Fahlgren N, Jogdeo S, Kasschau KD, Sullivan CM, Chapman EJ, Laubinger S, Smith LM, Dasenko M, Givan SA, Weigel D, Carrington JC."],["20122235","Genome-wide sequence-based prediction of peripheral proteins using a novel semi-supervised learning technique.","BMC Bioinformatics","2010","SRA009031","In supervised learning, traditional approaches to building a classifier use two sets of examples with pre-defined classes along with a learning algorithm.

We compared simulation results for traditional capillary sequencing with \"Next Generation\" (NG) ultra high-throughput technologies. The simulation model was parameterized using mappings of 130,000 cDNA sequence reads to the Arabidopsis genome (NCBI Accession SRA008180.19). We also generated 454-GS20 sequences and de novo assemblies for the basal eudicot California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) and the magnoliid avocado (Persea americana) using a variety of methods for cDNA synthesis.The Arabidopsis reads tagged more than 15,000 genes, including new splice variants and extended UTR regions. Of the total 134,791 reads (13.8 MB), 119,518 (88.7%) mapped exactly to known exons, while 1,117 (0.8%) mapped to introns, 11,524 (8.6%) spanned annotated intron/exon boundaries, and 3,066 (2.3%) extended beyond the end of annotated UTRs. Sequence-based inference of relative gene expression levels correlated significantly with microarray data. As expected, NG sequencing of normalized libraries tagged more genes than non-normalized libraries, although non-normalized libraries yielded more full-length cDNA sequences. The Arabidopsis data were used to simulate additional rounds of NG and traditional EST sequencing, and various combinations of each. Our simulations suggest a combination of FLX and Solexa sequencing for optimal transcriptome coverage at modest cost. We have also developed ESTcalc http://fgp.huck.psu.edu/NG_Sims/ngsim.pl, an online webtool, which allows users to explore the results of this study by specifying individualized costs and sequencing characteristics.NG sequencing technologies are a highly flexible set of platforms that can be scaled to suit different project goals. In terms of sequence coverage alone, the NG sequencing is a dramatic advance over capillary-based sequencing, but NG sequencing also presents significant challenges in assembly and sequence accuracy due to short read lengths, method-specific sequencing errors, and the absence of physical clones. These problems may be overcome by hybrid sequencing strategies using a mixture of sequencing methodologies, by new assemblers, and by sequencing more deeply. Sequencing and microarray outcomes from multiple experiments suggest that our simulator will be useful for guiding NG transcriptome sequencing projects in a wide range of organisms.","Wall PK, Leebens-Mack J, Chanderbali AS, Barakat A, Wolcott E, Liang H, Landherr L, Tomsho LP, Hu Y, Carlson JE, Ma H, Schuster SC, Soltis DE, Soltis PS, Altman N, dePamphilis CW."],["19066226","AGO1-miR173 complex initiates phased siRNA formation in plants.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","2008-Dec-23","SRA008240","MicroRNA (miRNA)-guided cleavage initiates entry of primary transcripts into the transacting siRNA (tasiRNA) biogenesis pathway involving RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6, DICER-LIKE4, and SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3.

Here, the TAS1c locus was modified to produce synthetic (syn) tasiRNA to target an endogenous transcript encoding PHYTOENE DESATURASE and used to analyze the role of miR173 in routing of transcripts through the tasiRNA pathway. miR173 was unique from other miRNAs in its ability to initiate TAS1c-based syn-tasiRNA formation. A single miR173 target site was sufficient to route non-TAS transcripts into the pathway to yield phased siRNA. We also show that miR173 functions in association with ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1) during TAS1 and TAS2 tasiRNA formation, and we provide data indicating that the miR173-AGO1 complex possesses unique functionality that many other miRNA-AGO1 complexes lack.","Montgomery TA, Yoo SJ, Fahlgren N, Gilbert SD, Howell MD, Sullivan CM, Alexander A, Nguyen G, Allen E, Ahn JH, Carrington JC."],["18542052","Global identification of microRNA-target RNA pairs by parallel analysis of RNA ends.","Nat Biotechnol","2008-Aug","SRA008384","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulatory molecules in most eukaryotes and identification of their target mRNAs is essential for their functional analysis.

Like validated targets, most showed a single abundant signature at the miRNA cleavage site, particularly in libraries from a mutant deficient in the 5'-to-3' exonuclease AtXRN4.

We find that ABH1/CBP80 is necessary to obtain proper mature miRNA levels, which suggests this protein affects the miRNA-mediated RNA silencing pathway. Additionally, we show that XRN4/EIN5 affects the levels of a smRNA class that is processed from both sense and antisense strands of approximately 130 endogenous transcripts that apparently are converted to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and subsequently processed. We find that the parent transcripts of these smRNAs accumulate in an uncapped form upon loss of XRN4/EIN5, which suggests that uncapped endogenous transcripts can become smRNA biogenesis substrates.
